College of Computing Associate Professor **David A. Bader** is one of eighty-three of the nation's brightest young engineers who have been selected to take part in the National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) 13th annual U.S. Frontiers of Engineering symposium. The two and a half-day event will bring together engineers ages 30 to 45 who are performing exceptional engineering research and technical work in a variety of disciplines. The participants — from industry, academia, and government — were nominated by fellow engineers or organizations. Participants were chosen from more than 260 nominations.

Bader is a pioneer in the use of high-performance computing for problems in bioinformatics and computational genomics. "High-performance computing is essential for solving 21st century problems such as the design of safe water technologies, developing sustainable biofuels, and engineering proteins, which will be key themes at this symposium,”  he said.

The symposium will be held September 24-26 at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash., and will examine trustworthy computer systems, safe water technologies, modeling and simulating human behavior, biotechnology for fuels and chemicals, and the control of protein conformations. Dr. Henrique Malvar, Microsoft Distinguished Engineer and managing director, Microsoft Research, will be a featured speaker. His research at Microsoft has focused on audio and video signal enhancement and compression, multirate signal processing, and signal decompositions. Prior to joining Microsoft Research, Malvar headed research and advanced technology at PictureTel and the Digital Signal Processing Research Group at Universidade de Brasília.

"It is exciting to witness the energy when outstanding engineers from many different fields come together in this unique venue," said NAE President William A. Wulf. "Frontiers of Engineering is a proven mechanism for traversing engineering disciplines. By exposing bright young minds to developments in areas other than their own — and giving them lots of time to interact — Frontiers enables advances in approaches and thinking that would not have occurred otherwise."

Sponsors for the 2007 U.S. Frontiers of Engineering are the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. Department of Defense (DDR&E-Research), DARPA, the National Science Foundation, Microsoft Corp., Cummins Inc., and numerous individual donors.

The National Academy of Engineering is an independent, nonprofit institution that serves as an adviser to government and the public on issues in engineering and technology. Its members consist of the nation's premier engineers, who are elected by their peers for their distinguished achievements. Established in 1964, NAE operates under the congressional charter granted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1863.
