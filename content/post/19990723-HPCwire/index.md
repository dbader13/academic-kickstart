The National Computational Science Alliance's
(Alliance) Linux Roadrunner Supercluster at the University of New Mexico
(UNM) is officially open for business as a node on the Alliance Grid.

  A prototype of the national information infrastructure of the 21st
century, the Alliance Grid is an emerging integrated computational and
collaborative environment that links people, resources, and services over
high speed networks. Joining the Alliance's arsenal of parallel computing
systems located at facilities from Boston to Maui, Roadrunner is a 64-node
AltaCluster by Alta Technology Corporation. Each node has two Intel 450 MHz
Pentium II processors  interconnected via a 1.2 Gbyte bandwidth Myrinet
network for high speed communications. The system runs on the Linux
operating system. The Roadrunner Supercluster has also been fully integrated
with the Globus Infrastructure, a high performance, distributed computing
toolkit that allows ready access to geographically distributed resources
such as superclusters and supercomputers, data repositories, scientific
instruments and visualization suites.

  The Roadrunner Supercluster was unveiled at an April 8 dedication at UNM's
Albuquerque High Performance Computing Center (AHPCC) and has been in a
"friendly-user" mode since June 1,operating as a production research
platform with user support services 24 hours a day. More than 50 Alliance
users have been test driving this speedy yet cost-effective system since
June. Early results from scientists reveal Roadrunner to be a promising
option for high-performance computing, especially relative to its price.

  UNM Professors **David A. Bader** and Barney Maccabe are in charge of the
efforts to evaluate the performance of scientific applications on
Roadrunner, and so far, they have been successful in making codes scale on
the nodes of the Supercluster.

  "Using the Cactus benchmark in scaling, the Roadrunner Supercluster
outperforms all other kinds of clusters," noted Bader. The Cactus code is a
modular manageable high-performance 3D tool for Numerical Relativity.

http://www.aei-potsdam.mpg.de/~wehrens/cactus/cluster/

  To further evaluate Roadrunner, MILC, a conjugate gradient algorithm for
Kogut-Susskind quarks, was used as a benchmark. "We are pleased to see that
the MILC benchmark achieved greater than 60 Mflops per processor on
Roadrunner, said Bader. He pointed out that this performance is significant
in terms of cost per flop when compared to the 76 Mflop performance per
processor of the Cray T3E 900, and the 120 Mflop performance on the SGI
Origin2000 using 250 MHz R10000 processors. For more information on MILC,
see http://www.physics.indiana.edu/~sg/milc.html

  Other advantages of the Roadrunner Supercluster include ease of system
administration and software availability, often from the public domain. In
fact almost all software, including the operating system, schedulers,
compilers, and applications, is constantly being rewritten and improved as
part of the open system development. Usability and portability are other
features of the Linux Supercluster.  Dr. Dan Weber, Research Scientist from
the Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms at the University of
Oklahoma, discovered that "Porting code to the Supercluster is transparent.
I had models running in less than 30 minutes."

  Bader and Maccabe, and Rob Pennington, technical program manager for the
Alliance NT Supercluster team, will present a Supercluster tutorial and
forum at the upcoming Alliance Chautauquas 99. The Chautauqua program begins
August 9 - 10 at UNM, and continues with programs August 23-24 at the
University of Kentucky, and September 14-15 at Boston University. For more
on the Chautauquas, see http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/alliance/chautauqua/ Bader,
Maccabe, and Pennington will also present a workshop on Superclusters at
SC99 in Portland OR, November 13-19.

  Roadrunner Project Engineer Patricia Kovatch says that academic users may
request allocations of up to 4,000 CPU hours at http://www.alliance.unm.edu
Larger allocations can be requested from the Alliance Allocation Board at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/alliance/applying/Overview.html "We're open for
business," Kovatch noted, "and we're planning enhancements in the near
future, including implementing a high performance, scalable storage
subsystem. We sent a survey to the initial users asking for feedback and
ideas to improve the supercluster."

  The National Computational Science Alliance is a partnership to prototype
an advanced computational infrastructure for the 21st century and includes
more than 50 academic, government and industry research partners from across
the United States. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is the leading-edge site for
the Alliance. The Alliance is one of two partnerships funded by the National
Science Foundation's Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure
(PACI) program and receives cost-sharing at partner institutions. NSF also
supports the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure
(NPACI), led by the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
