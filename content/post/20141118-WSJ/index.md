[Google](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GOOGL) 's computers learned to recognize cats in photos. Now, they’re learning to describe cats playing
with a ball of string.

Computer scientists in the search giant’s research division, and a separate team working at Stanford
University, independently developed artificial-intelligence software that can decipher the action in a photo,
and write a caption to describe it. That’s a big advance over previous software that was mostly limited to
recognizing objects.

[In a blog post](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GOOGL), Google described how it is using advanced “machine-learning” techniques that mimic the
human brain to recognize a photo of “a person riding a motorcycle on a dirt road,” or “a herd of elephants
walking across a dry grass field.”
The new software can “capture the whole scene and generate corresponding natural-looking text,” says
Yoshua Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal and a leading expert in the
field. That defies predictions that software would be limited to recognizing objects, he said.

The new technology could lead to big improvements in the accuracy of Google’s image-search results,
which today often rely on text found near a photo on a web page. One day it might help people search
vast libraries of untagged photos or videos stored on smartphones, says **David Bader**, a professor of
computer science at Georgia Tech. A startup called Viblio is using similar research out of Simon Fraser
University to automatically categorize videos.

In 2012, a Google/Stanford team famously [taught a computer to learn how to recognize cats](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209). The
computer was shown millions of images from YouTube videos, and used then-state-of-the-art machinelearning
algorithms to teach itself to spot felines.

Similar advances are helping improve other Google services. Earlier this year, Google researchers
disclosed how its computers had [learned to read house numbers](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6082v4.pdf) from images captured by its Street View
cars, making it quicker and easier to locate buildings in Google Maps, for instance.

Google is making big bets on artificial-intelligence technology. Earlier this year, it paid hundreds of millions
of dollars to acquire Deep Mind Technologies, a London-based startup that employs many specialists in
advanced machine learning. Earlier, it bought DNNResearch, a small company started at the University of
Toronto, in order to hire a top academic in machine learning, Geoffrey Hinton.

Artificial-intelligence research also helps speech-recognition software, used by smartphone assistants like
[Apple](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=AAPL) 's Siri or Google voice search.

Others also are investing in the field. [Facebook](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=FB) scooped up a top artificial-intelligence academic late last
year. Meanwhile, Chinese search engine [Baidu has said it will invest $300 million](http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579565950123054242) in an artificial intelligence
lab in Silicon Valley. To lead the lab, Baidu hired the head of Stanford’s artificial-intelligence lab, Andrew
Ng, who helped build the computer that taught itself to recognize cats from YouTube videos.
