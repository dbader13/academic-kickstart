The Georgia Institute of Technology, an emerging leader in highperformance
computing research and education, will command a significant presence at next
week's SC08, the international conference on high-performance computing, networking,
storage and analysis scheduled for Nov. 15-21, 2008, at the Austin Convention Center in
Austin, Texas. Georgia Tech will co-chair one workshop, participate in four panel (or "Birdsof-
a-Feather") discussions, present three technical papers and one research poster, and host
16 booth presentations and video interviews on emerging high-performance computing
projects and application areas.

"At Georgia Tech, we believe a strong and expansive high-performance computing research
community drives the bigger scientific discoveries and better engineering capabilities at the
heart of human progress," said Dr. Mark Allen, senior vice provost for Research and
Innovation at Georgia Tech. "Through this premier industry event, researchers, academics
and industry professionals have the opportunity to discuss and demonstrate new innovations
and breakthroughs in high-impact areas such as biomedicine, nanoscience, astrophysics and
exascale computing. Georgia Tech welcomes SC08 attendees to visit our booth, meet our
researchers, observe our work and understand our mission to positively affect quality of life
through advanced computing capabilities."
