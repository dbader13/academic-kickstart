A project funded through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would identify the most serious insider threats to security by scanning all user e-mail messages, text messages, logins, file transfers and Web browsing on military networks, reports Katie Drummond at Wired's [Danger Room blog](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/darpa-email/#more-66805).

The two-year Proactive Discovery of Insider Threats Using Graph Analysis and Learning (PRODIGAL) project is being is being conducted by a consortium of five institutions led by **Georgia Tech**. The project falls under a larger initiative known as Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales, which applies various technologies to scour through massive datasets.

By scanning an estimated 250 million e-mail messages, instant messages and file transfers daily, PRODIGAL might lead officials to a WikiLeaker before that person breaks the law. After the technology is ready, it will initially only be tested on government officials and military personnel whoâ€™ve agreed to be monitored, DARPA officials told the blog.
