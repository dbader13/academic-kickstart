The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) [has announced](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/njit-to-establish-new-institute-for-data-science/) that it is establishing a new Institute for Data Science directed by **David Bader**. Bader — one of HPCwire‘s 2014 [People to Watch](https://www.hpcwire.com/people-watch-2014/david-bader-2/) — recently joined NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing from Georgia Tech, where he was chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Computing.

“The new institute and its distinguished director will be a giant leap forward for NJIT’s research enterprise,” said Atam P. Dhawan, senior vice provost for research at NJIT. “Beyond the increase in basic research that the new institute will generate, we will also collaborate closely in applied research with the thriving tech ecosystem in the greater New York metro area. These companies are hungry for data science expertise and solutions, and we will be in an excellent position to provide them.”
