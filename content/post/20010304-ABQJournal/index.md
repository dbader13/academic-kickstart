**David A. Bader**, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of New Mexico, has been awarded the **National Science Foundation's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award**.

"Parallel computing has long offered the promise of very high performance, but it has delivered only in a narrow range of applications," Bader said. "With the advent of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs), however, shared memory on a modest scale is becoming an available commodity. Over the next five to 10 years, clusters of SMPs will likely be the predominant architecture for scalable high-performance computing."

Bader's research plan will investigate new algorithms to support irregular computations, mostly tree- and graph-based, along with new insights on how to leverage the theoretical research in PRAM algorithms.
