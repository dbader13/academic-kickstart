Our featured community member this week is **Dr. David Bader**, Distinguished Professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology.

Without doing too much ego-boosting, we can just say David is a graph-addict for a long time before it was a ‘thing’. Alongside his role as a professor, he’s a fellow of the IEEE, AAAS, and SIAM, advises the White House, and the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI). David has also co-authored over 250 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

While this is all incredibly impressive, what we would like to highlight is David’s strong desire to share graph thinking with the world. If you talk to David about graphs, the conversation will likely go for hours (as most of us graph-addicts relate to).

He’s a natural thought-leader, not just in the sense of a hobby, but as a career path. As a Distinguished Professor at NJIT, he inspires growing minds to explore capabilities inside connected data (shameless plug for our educators out there: check out the [Neo4j Edu Program](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/edu-program)) . David even recently brought in [Mike Zelenetz](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invite-sent/michael-zelenetz-37b89438) to present in his classroom presenting on ‘Graphing a Hospital’.

David is regularly looking for interesting presentations in his classroom, so if you’re interested, you can contact him on the [Neo4j Community Site](https://community.neo4j.com/t/david-bader-worlds-leading-graph-expert-prof-davidbader-georgiatech/1897?_ga=2.148574583.1733116107.1574169088-2130131488.1574169088)). You can also just ping him if you’re interested in nerding about graphs for hours…just be warned, he’s really knowledgeable and passionate – you’re head may explode with what you learn. :-)

Oh, and if you ever head over to Georgia Institute of Technology, where David used to work, make sure you check out the graph-theory inspired, [7 Bridges of Königsberg courtyard](https://arts.gatech.edu/content/seven-bridges-konigsberg).

David, we are so grateful to have kind and giving graph-addicts like you in our community. Thank you for all that you do!
