Finding a cure for AIDS is the greatest medical challenge of our age, Antonia C. Novello, surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service, said yesterday.

Novello, the first woman and first Hispanic to hold the position of surgeon general, received an honorary doctor of science degree during Lehigh University's sixth annual winter commencement.

Lehigh conferred degrees upon 90 area residents yesterday in Packer Memorial Church. The students are among 244 men and women who completed their degree requirements during the fall semester and will receive bachelor's, master's or doctoral degrees.

"Never for a moment think you will pass unaffected by AIDS," she told the capacity audience in the church. "No other disease has had an impact like AIDS."

With increased heterosexual transmissions, she predicted that, by the year 2000, 40 million people worldwide will be infected with AIDS. By the end of the decade the disease will orphan 10 million children.

"Behind every statistic is a human being," Novello said.

Beyond the AIDS epidemic, she identified violence as another crisis to overcome, saying, "This country must stop accepting violence as a way of life."

Novello also encouraged graduates to be sensitive to all ethnic and age groups and to avoid complacency, mediocrity and indifference. "Develop a healthy skepticism," Novello said, because in five years much of what was learned in the classroom will be obsolete.

Test and challenge new ideas, she said. "The harder you work, the luckier you will be. The world owes you nothing."

In a brief meeting with the media following the exercises, Novello flatly said "no" when asked if a national health-care plan would evolve under her stewardship.

To be affordable and of high quality, health coverage must combine federal, local, public and private sources, all under one roof, she said. She said she hopes the president will present a plan when he comes before Congress this month.

In the coming years, medical philosophy will advocate prevention first, rather than searching for cures.

In 1988, $90 million dollars was spent on prevention, compared to today's $297 million. For every dollar spent on prevention, $14 is saved in medical costs. In her address, she said heart disease could be reduced by 45 percent through prevention.

An honorary degree was also awarded to Morris Tanenbaum, retired vice chairman of the board of AT&T.; John Brooks Slaughter, president of Occidental College in Los Angeles, Calif., who was to receive an honorary degree, but was forced to decline because of a last-minute change in travel plans.

Tanenbaum, who developed the first silicon-diffused base transistors and led the group that discovered practical materials for superconducting magnets, received an honorary doctor of science degree.

Degrees were awarded individually to the students by Peter Likins, president of the university.

Candidates for degrees were presented by James D. Gunton, dean of the College of Arts and Science; Richard W. Barsness, dean of the College of Business and Economics; Sunder H. Advani, new dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science; and Alden J. Moe, dean of the College of Education.

Alan W. Pense, university provost and vice president for academic affairs, presented the candidates for honorary degrees. Roy C. Herrenkohl, vice provost for research and dean of graduate studies, placed appropriate hoods on the shoulders of the candidates.

The Rev. John S. Mraz, Catholic chaplain and director of the campus Newman Center, gave the invocation and asked the benediction.

Raymond Bell, professor of education and social relations, served as university marshal. Fazil Erdogan, professor of mechanical engineering and mechanics, carried the mace in the processional and recessional. Fred P. Stein, professor of chemical engineering, was the chief faculty usher.

Following the ceremony, a reception for the new graduates and their guests was held in the Asa Packer Room of the University Center.

Seven Army and Air Force cadets who have completed the ROTC program at Lehigh were commissioned as second lieutenants in their respective services at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, in Upper Grace Hall.

Those being commissioned included Cadet Christina M. Balum of Hellertown, a Moravian College student, Army.
