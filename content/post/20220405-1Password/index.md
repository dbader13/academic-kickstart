## EPISODE SUMMARY ##

This week we discover the real-world capabilities of supercomputers in cybersecurity and how data analysis can uncover insider threats with **Distinguished Professor David Bader**. We also wind back the clock and look at how far computing has come, from David's work building the first ever Linux supercomputer to the revolutionary chip inside the PlayStation 3.

Plus, in Watchtower Weekly, we discuss the recent Okta data breach and the new password sharing fee Netflix is testing. Finally, if Roo's mind wasn't blown enough, we play the Random but Memorable meta edition of Ridiculous Requirements!
