*By Alan Beck, managing editor*

  Contrary to strident popular opinion, the enervating quality of the Web is
generated more through an abundance of information rather than an
accumulation of moral deficits. Nowhere is this more evident than in the
enormous collection of sites dealing with HPC. This new column, slated to
appear quarterly, is not meant to provide a thorough compendium of
HPC-related material on the Web; several resources already perform that
function quite admirably, e.g. **David A. Bader**'s page,
http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~dbader/sites.html, CalTech's list,
http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/other_sites.html, Jonathan Hardwick's page,
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/resources.html and others. Nor can it hope to
review sites of inordinate significance; while journalists may lay legitimate
claim to insight, they cannot do the same for prescience.

  Ideally, what the column can accomplish is simply this: to pique the
curiosity of a few interested readers -- perhaps motivating them to
investigate promising areas they may have inadvertendly neglected -- and to
provide some notion, however inadequate, of the breadth and depth of HPC
resources currently residing in cyberspace. Only time -- and reader comments
-- will tell if these goals are being met, or, indeed, if they are worth
pursuing at all.

Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) Primer   
  http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~palepu/bsp_primer.html

  The handiwork of Ravi Palepu at Carlton University's School of Computer
Science, this site offers a thorough grounding in elements of the BSP model
of parallel computing. Palepu covers BSP's evolution, components, algorithms,
languages and extensions. He notes: "the BSP model directs the programmer to
perform many local referenced memory operations before making a non-local
reference. After a sequence of local memory reference operations and at most
only one nonlocal memory reference, a global barrier synchronization is
performed. At this time, all processors are blocked until nonlocal memory
references can be carried out. This sequence of steps is called a superstep.
A series of supersteps would encompass the entire computation."

  For those committed to exploring all avenues for more efficient utilization
of parallel environments, Palepu's presentation is certainly worth a look --
or even more: Harvard and Oxford are actively doing work in this area.

Fermilab's Computation Division   
  http://www.fnal.gov/cd/

  A good antidote for those inclined toward cynicism about nationally-funded
HPC efforts, Fermilab provides a wealth of useful resources for those with
interests extending into areas beyond its specialty of particle physics
proper, including UNIX and standard resources, CAD, parallel and distributed
computing, and databases.

Visualization of Parallel and Distributed Programs   
  http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/softviz/parviz/parviz.html

  This remarkable Georgia Tech site provides numerous striking images
generated through PARADE, an environment designed to enable visualization of
the dynamics of parallel and distributed programs. As visualization is
proving to be an invaluable tool for understanding physical, chemical,
economic and other complex processes, this site has taken the matter a step
further, turning the mirror of illuminating graphics upon advanced
computation itself. The results must be seen to be appreciated. Devotees of
20th century art (like this reviewer) will find the experience as impressive
aesthetically as it is analytically revealing.
