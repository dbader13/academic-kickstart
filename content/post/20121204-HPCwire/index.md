Emcien Corp., a leading provider of pattern-based
analytics solutions, announced today the addition of
internationally renowned High-Performance
Computing luminary **Dr. David A. Bader** to the Emcien
Advisory Board, thereby lending his expertise to
Emcien’s next generation of solutions designed for
massive-scale analytics in real time in multiple
sectors, including government, financial services,
healthcare, medical research, and insurance. Dr.
Bader is a recognized leader in designing large-scale
parallel algorithms for data-intensive problems, such
as social network analysis, as well as for his
decades-long research and innovation in dataintensive
computing.

“This technology is uniquely positioned at the
intersection of high-performance computing and
graph analytics, so I am pleased to join Emcien’s
Advisory Board,” said Dr. Bader. “Emcien’s
technological approach tackles one of the biggest
challenges with Big Data, namely what are the right
questions one should be asking? Graph analytics
quickly discovers the value within massive datasets
by making connections between disparate, seemingly
unrelated bits of information, and by finding the
highest-ranked of these connections to focus on for
critical insights.”

Dr. Bader is a professor in the School of
Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing and Executive Director for High Performance
Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. His interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing
and real-world applications, including data analytics.

“Companies are facing a data overload, and solutions that combine graph analytics with combinatorial
optimization are critical to delivering the true value hidden in an organization’s Big Data,” said Radhika
Subramanian, CEO, Emcien. “Therefore, we are pleased Dr. Bader is joining the Emcien Advisory Board. His
expertise in High Performance Computing adds to our relentless focus on developing the best-in-class suite of
patented pattern-based analytics solutions and enables us to deliver significant value in the form of operational
efficiency, new sources of revenue, and an unsurpassed competitive advantage to organizations across sectors.”

Dr. Bader received his Ph.D. in 1996 from The University of Maryland, is an IEEE and AAAS Fellow, and his
research is supported through highly-competitive research awards, primarily from NSF, NIH, DARPA, and DOE. Dr.
Bader serves on the Steering Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences. He has served on the Research
Advisory Council for Internet2 and has chaired several of the flagship professional meetings in parallel and highperformance
computing. He is an associate editor-in-chief of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing
(JPDC) and serves as an associate editor for several high impact publications, including ACM Journal of
Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), Parallel Computing, and Journal of Computational Science, and has been an
associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). He was elected as chair of
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) and as chair of the SIAM Activity
Group in Supercomputing (SIAG/SC). He has co-authored over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals and
conferences, and his main areas of research are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and massivescale
social networks.
