With online data, you have to be extremely careful about how you go about saving it. From sensitive files to a string of letters and numbers we call passwords, it can begin to seem like a full-time job managing it all.

We’re here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be. As one of the [best password protectors](https://nypost.com/article/best-password-managers-per-experts/) (per a cybersecurity expert), [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) deserves much acclaim.

For one, the service has made it simpler to manage your data. It’s essentially a platform to aggregate all your top-secret, personal information in one place, from the hundreds of online accounts you use on occasion to the access code of your parent’s apartment.

“Dashlane software has been available for a decade, and runs either as a browser extension on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, or on a mobile device such as iOS and Android,” **David Bader**, PhD, distinguished professor of data science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), told the New York Post. “Similar with 1Password and Keeper, Dashlane uses PBKDF2 on your device and industry-standard 256-bit AES encryption to protect your passwords in the secure vault.”

What’s more, Dashlane is used by more than 15 million people and more than 20,000 companies worldwide. The company also has a free version that can store up to 50 passwords from one device.

“For users who purchase a license, Dashlane has also partnered with HotSpot Shield to provide a VPN, which adds a layer of protection for your browsing and data when you’re connecting to the Internet on public WiFi,” Bader adds. Plus, it’s $90 a year for a family of six.

Oh, and you don’t have to manage a Fortune 500 company to benefit from Dashlane’s services, either. The platform offers pricing for both personal and business plans, along with offering a concrete option for families.

In other words, Dashlane wants your entire household to be protected (no more asking your parents or children “what’s the password” any longer)!

Also, you’ll be glad to know that in the 10+ years Dashlane has been in operation, it has **never** had a security breach. Plus, there are more than 125,000 five-star ratings in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
