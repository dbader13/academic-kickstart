**Dr. David Bader**, who earned his doctoral degree from the Department in May 1996, has received a National Science Foundation (NSF) Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award for his work on High-Performance Algorithms for Scientific Applications.

This prestigious grant emphasizes the importance NSF places on the early development of academic careers dedicated to research, inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.

Bader's CAREER research plan will investigate new algorithms to support irregular computations, mostly tree and graph-based, along with new insights on how to leverage the theoretical research in PRAM algorithms.  Science-driven problems in genomics, bioinformatics, and computational ecology will provide the focus for his research.

Bader is an assistant professor and Regents' Lecturer in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of New Mexico.  His advisor at Maryland was Prof. Joseph JáJá.
