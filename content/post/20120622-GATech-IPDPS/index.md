The 26th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) took place May 21-25, 2012, in Shanghai, China. Georgia
Tech’s participation in the technical program included 23 faculty and students presenting six accepted papers, eight workshops, two Ph.D. Forum
research posters, as well as roles in the sessions and invited panel talks. IPDPS, which drew more than 600 participants this year, is an
international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation.
In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations &
exhibits.

Below is a breakdown of Georgia Tech’s activities in the technical program.
