**Prof. David A. Bader** has been awarded the National Science Foundation's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award. This highly prestigious grant in High-Performance Algorithms for Scientific Applications emphasizes the importance NSF places on the early development of academic careers dedicated to stimulating the discovery process in which the excitement of research is enhanced by inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning. Parallel computing has long offered the promise of very high performance, but it has delivered only in a narrow range of applications. With the advent of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs), however, shared-memory on a modest scale is becoming an available commodity. Over the next five to ten years, clusters of SMPs will likely be the predominant architecture for scalable high-performance computing; however, little work has been done to date to support effective parallel computing on these SMP clusters. Prof. Bader's CAREER research plan will investigate new algorithms to support irregular computations, mostly tree- and graph- based, along with new insights on how to leverage the theoretical research in PRAM algorithms. Science-driven problems in genomics,bioinformatics, and computational ecology will provide the focus for this research. Prof. Bader directs the EECE Department's High-Performance Computing Laboratory located in Room 217.
