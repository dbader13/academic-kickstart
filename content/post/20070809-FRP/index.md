The Office of the Provost has awarded Focused Research Program (FRP) funding for research proposals in high performance computing for $30,000 and web science for $29,313. The proposals were coordinated by College of Computing Associate Professor **David A. Bader** and co-coordinated by Associate Professors Amy Bruckman and Milena Mihail, respectively.

An FRP is a grant given by the Georgia Tech Provost's Office designed to provide start-up support for research programs that could not be carried out through individual effort or within the resources of a single unit. Normally, an FRP involves a group of faculty members from more than one unit and is intended to provide start-up support for coordinated research projects that have the potential to develop into research centers within one to two years.

**Dr. Bader** coordinated the proposal entitled "Focused Research Program in High-Performance Computing" on behalf of researchers in the College of Computing, the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences. Drs. Bruckman and Mihail's proposal, entitled "Focused Research Program in Web Science," is a collaboration among researchers in 11 units: Interactive Computing; Computer Science; International Affairs; Architecture; Public Policy; Literature, Communications and Culture; Electrical and Chemical Engineering; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Management; and Mathematics.

In all, fifteen proposals across campus for FRPs were submitted, five of which were approved.
