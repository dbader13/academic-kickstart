The Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub Seed Fund will be launching by this fall to support data science activities within our community. We are pleased to announce **David Bader** as Chair of the Seed Fund Steering Committee. Bader is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and inaugural Director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, and a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. Our [full Seed Fund Steering Committee](http://nebigdatahub.org/seedfund/) met for the first time earlier this month, and is hard at work developing and executing on this exciting new community program.
