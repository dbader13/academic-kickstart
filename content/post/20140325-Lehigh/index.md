Georgia Tech’s College of Computing has selected **David A. Bader** '90 '91G, a renowned leader in high-performance computing, to chair its School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). A professor in the School of CSE and executive director of its High-Performance Computing Lab, Bader will assume his new role in July 2014.

Bader, a 1987 graduate of [Liberty High School](http://www-lhs.beth.k12.pa.us/) in Bethlehem, PA, attended Lehigh University, where he earned a bachelor's in computer engineering in 1990 and  a master's in electrical engineering in 1991. In 2005 he joined Georgia Tech’s College of Computing; he became a full professor in 2008 and played an integral role in the formation of the School of CSE.

An expert in the design and analysis of parallel and multicore algorithms for real-world applications, including computational biology and genomics and massive-scale data analytics, Bader has won highly-competitive awards from the National Science Foundation (NSF), IBM, Microsoft, Sony, and Sun Microsystems. He has co-chaired a series of meetings, the IEEE International Workshop on High-Performance Computational Biology (HiCOMB), written several book chapters, and co-edited a special issue of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing on High-Performance Computational Biology. He has co-authored over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Bader has earned recognition as a fellow with both IEEE and AAAS, received a National Science Foundation CAREER award and numerous industry awards. InsideHPC recognized him as a "RockStar" of high-performance computing, and HPCwire cited him among "People to Watch" in both 2012 and 2014. 

"I believe that the School of CSE has firmly established itself as the country’s premier department focused on solving real-world challenges through advanced computational techniques, thanks to a world-class faculty and dedicated students," says Bader. "My plan as school chair is to accelerate our impactful research and gain recognition for further successes by solving grand challenges that make this world a better place for all."
