**David Bader**, associate professor within the College of Computing's Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) division, was co-organizer and steering committee member of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) 2006, held in Rhodes, Greece on April 25-29.

IPDPS celebrated its 20th year and is considered the premier academic conference in the areas of parallel and distributed computing. Not only did David serve as a program vice-chair for the Applications Track, he also chairs the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Technical Committee on Parallel Processing, which sponsors IPDPS. This year's symposium had over 550 attendees and included 125 peer-reviewed papers, four keynotes and over 20 workshops. Being highly regarded by the professional community as the annual meeting for top research results in the field, IPDPS 2006 had strong international participation with approximately equal attendance from the U.S., Europe and Asia.
