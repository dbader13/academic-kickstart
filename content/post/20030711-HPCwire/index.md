Prof. **David A. Bader**, an Associate Professor and Regents' Lecturer in the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The University of New
Mexico, has been elected Chair of the IEEE Computer Society's Technical
Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP). The Chair serves a two-year term
beginning July 1. The TCPP acts as an international forum to promote parallel
processing research and education, and participates in setting up technical
standards in this area. Issues related to the design, analysis and
implementation of parallel systems and solutions are of interest. These
include design and analysis of parallel architectures and algorithms, and
application development on parallel machines. TCPP sponsors professional
meetings, brings out publications, sets guidelines for educational programs
and coordinates academia, funding agency, and industry activities in the above
areas. The International Parallel and Distributed Processing  Symposium
(IPDPS), held annually in the Spring, serves as the flagship  activity of this
TC. Several workshops  spanning interdisciplinary areas  are sponsored by this
TC.

David A. Bader is an Associate Professor and Regents' Lecturer in the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of The University of New
Mexico (UNM).  He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1996 from
The University of Maryland, and was awarded a National Science Foundation
(NSF) Postdoctoral Research Associateship in Experimental Computer Science
before joining UNM in 1998.  He is an NSF CAREER Award recipient, an
investigator on six NSF awards including three ITR awards, a distinguished
speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitors Program, and is a
member of the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems
program.  Dr. Bader serves on the Steering Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC
conferences, and is the General co-Chair for IPDPS (2004-2005), and Vice
General Chair for HiPC (2002-2003). He has served on numerous conference
program committees related to parallel processing, is an associate editor for
the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics in the area of parallel
algorithms, a Senior Member of the IEEE Computer Society, and a Member of the
ACM. Dr. Bader has given several Keynote Talks on high-performance computing
for problems in computational genomics.  He has co-authored over 38 articles
in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his main areas of research are
in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and computational biology
and genomics.

Prof. **Bader** is the general co-chair of IPDPS 2004 (http://www.ipdps.org),
which will be held at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, April 26-30, 2004.
