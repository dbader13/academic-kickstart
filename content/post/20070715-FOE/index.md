The thirteenth annual US Frontiers of Engineering Symposium was held in September, 2007, in Redmond Washington.  Chaired by Julia M. Phillips of Sandia National Laboratories, the meeting included sessions on Engineering trustworthy computer systems, Control of protein conformations, Biotechnology for fuels and chemicals, Modeling and simulating human behavior, and Safe water technologies.


US Frontiers of Engineering is an annual meeting that brings together 100 of the nation's outstanding young engineers (ages 30-45) from industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering technical and leading-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. Participation is by invitation following a competitive nomination and selection process.
