Dear **Mr. Bader**:

Your proposal "Parallel Algorithms for Massively Parallel Architectures," for a NASA Graduate Researchers Program (GSRP) Fellowship was rated very highly by our review panel.  Consequently, it is my pleasure to offer you a 1992 GSRP Fellowship award. Congratulations!

This year, I received more than 75 proposals for GSRP Fellowships at Goddard.  Most of them were quite impressive, but only a few could be funded. The fact that yours is among them speaks highly of your academic record and of the research project which you are proposing. The funding of your fellowship will come from the new fellowship allotment I received from NASA Headquarters.  Yours is one of only seven such fellowships which are being funded this year.  Dr. John E. Dorband has expressed considerable interest in your work and will serve as the technical advisor for your fellowship.

...

Sincerely,

Gerald A. Soffen   
Director of University Programs
