Luckily, one of the 13 best antivirus software programs of 2022 can help.

“A computer virus is a malicious piece of software that spreads between computers and can harm your computer or steal your information,” **[David Bader, PhD](https://people.njit.edu/faculty/bader)**, distinguished professor of data science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) told the New York Post. “For instance, viruses can delete your files, watch your keystrokes (and grab your login information for your online bank account), or turn your computer into a weapon to attack corporate or government websites.”

For unmatched protection, check out the best antivirus software programs, as vetted by our cybersecurity expert. For more on what these entail — including what malware, spyware and adware actually mean — check out our FAQ section below.

For the past 35 years, McAfee has held a premium spot as one of the earliest and best-known companies offering antivirus software. It offers antivirus software for all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS). “McAfee has a 30-day free trial with “all-in-one” protection that includes a VPN for privacy when using public WiFi networks, web protection to avoid phishing scams, identity monitoring, and more,” Bader adds.

For new customers, McAfee’s basic edition protects up to five devices and costs $35 for the first year and $85 per year after that. For an additional $45 per year, the premium edition adds parental controls and protects up to ten devices, and for another $30 per year, McAfee’s ultimate edition protects an unlimited number of devices and includes $1 million of identity theft coverage and identity restoration assistance.

The Antivirus Plus offers protection for a single PC or Mac at $10 for the first year, and $60 a year thereafter. This service includes Anti-Spyware, 2GB of cloud backup, a smart firewall, a password manager and an online privacy monitor, too.

If you’d like more protection on your smartphone and tablet, its 360 bundle is $85 per year (now on sale for just $30!), upping the cloud backup to 10GB and including a VPN for public WiFi use. For more protection including for smartphones and tablets, Norton offers its Norton 360 bundles with the standard version ($85/year) increasing the cloud backup to 10GB, and incorporating a VPN for public WiFi use.


## 3. AVG Ultimate, $60 for the first year ##

AVG Ultimate offers antivirus protection for PC, Mac, Android, and iOIS, and costs $60 for the first year, and $128 per year after that, for protecting up to 10 devices. In addition to antivirus protection, AVG Ultimate also has an array of nifty features:

The ultimate protection, however, is ESET Smart Security Premium: $60 per year per device with an included password manager, sensitive data encryption and protection against new threats. “It’s disappointing, though, that a customer must buy this higher cost package to be protected against never-before-seen threats,” Bader commented.

## 12. Sophos Home Premium ##

Sophos Home Premium costs $45 for all of your Windows and Mac devices and is “basic antivirus software that scans and cleans malware from your system, protects your privacy online, and has parental web filtering,” per Bader. Conveniently, there are no complicated add-ons and upgraded packages.

## An FAQ on Antivirus Software ##

### What is a computer virus? ###

Nobody likes them, but it’s important to know how these pesky tech inconveniences and breaches begin.

“Viruses can propagate in many ways such as through email attachments, unwitting downloads from infected websites, and through shared USB memory sticks,” Bader explains. “Antivirus software exists for all popular computing platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS) and scans your system, memory, and files (including downloads) for known viruses.”

When the antivirus software detects a virus, it may take several actions including cleaning the virus from the system and placing infected files in quarantine. 

### What benefits come with some antivirus software, besides protection? ###

Aside from giving you (and your files) peace of mind, Bader highlights other add-ons some programs include.

“Antivirus software often comes bundled with other security features such as secure password keepers, protection against clicking on malicious links to websites and scans of the dark web to find if your information has been compromised and potentially sold to hackers,” he notes.

### What does malware mean? ###

Malware is malicious software that you may receive through an email attachment or other file transfer that can take over your computer if you run it.  “Be cautious when clicking on links in the body of emails from unknown or faked senders, or opening any file sent to you that you weren’t expecting,” Bader tips off. “These are the main ways hackers send you malware.”

### What does spyware mean? ###

More niche, spyware is a type of malware that watches everything you do on the computer and steals information. “For instance, spyware can monitor your keystrokes for all of your passwords, including ones for your bank accounts, social media, and email accounts,” Bader explains. “Spyware gathers information that can be used against your or your business and sends it to third parties who may sell the private information on the dark web or craft even more personalized attacks against you and your friends.”

### What does adware mean? ###

According to Bader, adware is different from spyware and is generally unwanted software, usually connected to your web browser, that watches your activity and puts annoying ads up on your screen. Some antivirus software packages can scan and remove adware from your computer.

### Is antivirus software necessary? ###

Like your car and home insurance, investing about $20 to $50 yearly is surely worth it. Not to mention, the service pairs well with a [password protector](https://nypost.com/article/best-password-managers-per-experts/), too.
