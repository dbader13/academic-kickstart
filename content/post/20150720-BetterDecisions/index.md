Companies and governments increasingly rely on ‘big data’ to operate efficiently and competitively. Analytics and security must
keep pace. What research underpins the latest big data-enabled
advances?

Good decisions are well-informed
decisions, of late powered by a diversity of data. Big data is creating profound business and
social opportunities in nearly every field because of its ability to speed discovery and customize solutions. Yet without the means to
synthesize and protect data, we risk not being able to do what we intended: make the right decisions.

This junction of big data and security shapes an increasingly important area of research that uses high-performance
cyber
analytics – led by research universities and industry in partnership.

Everyday, enterprise systems create a deluge of data: power grid use across a metropolitan area, millions of credit card
transactions per hour, social network relationships, or the spread of contagious disease. One might think that so much data
requires more time to analyze and draw conclusions, but in practice, big data now allows us to make near realtime
responses. How
is this possible?

Research universities act here, using graph analytics and by creating new visualization methods to give government and industry
actionable knowledge from growing mounds of data. Streaming graphs, for example, detect structural changes and flows, spot
clustering or key actors and highlight subtle anomalies. Graph analytics require large-scale,
high-performance
computers that can
trace trillions of interconnected vertices and edges that change over time. Projects such as Georgia Tech’s STINGER offers an
opensource
way to understand data with large, streaming graphs. Much university work is by nature open source and open to all –
providing a standard which others can improve upon without having to reinvent.

Further, streaming graphs can be combined with techniques from machine learning to be more effective. A machine might be fed
information and trained to know how a well-behaved
employee normally operates, using information extracted from the masses of
data. Then, when an action deviates from the norm, an alert results. This is especially useful in business environments where
employees connect to proprietary data via numerous mobile devices. Even the best employees now must be monitored because
they may be unwittingly used in cybercrime.

Contrary to common fears, the more data we share, the more secure we may actually become. The big data behind employee
behavior analysis, for example, enables new cyber security approaches that discover subtle, previously hidden suspicious
changes and guide quick responses before expensive damage is done. In the end, not only can that keep organizations safe; it too
can inform the right decisions.

“Under the hood” fixes that don’t involve human actions will be another area of advancement in the realm of big data and cyber
security. Devices need smart tools for self-correction
and even the ability to clean up after a successful attack. Also, static security
defenses, such as firewalls and malware, have taxed computing power. Universities are studying how to increase computational
power, which will help future cyber security solutions. For example, leading universities and industry are working on a national need
to increase computational efficiency by 75-fold
over the best current systems.

National laboratories and universities are environments of open innovation, where partnerships with industry permit computer
scientists to work with real problems and real data. This is what leads to true societal solutions that industry can deploy. Much of
today and tomorrow’s cyber security work will require heavy hitting computation, which industry usually cannot do alone. Therefore,
it begins with and revolves around sharing.

Computing is, and always has been, about making better decisions faster. With every advance, technology solves some issues and
introduces others. There will be challenges. But big data-enabled
security keeps a nation devoted to knowledge-based
innovation
on the offensive. High-performance
cyber analytics – in partnership between industry and academia – is the next underpinning for
national progress and everyone’s security.
