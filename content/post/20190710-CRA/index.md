Former CRA Board Member **David Bader** will direct the new institute for data science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). The institute will focus on cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and development in all areas pertinent to digital data. It will bring existing research centers in big data, medical informatics and cybersecurity together with new research centers in data analytics and artificial intelligence, cutting across all NJIT colleges and schools, and conduct both basic and applied research.

Bader recently joined NJITâ€™s Ying Wu College of Computing from Georgia Tech, where he was chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Computing.

From the [news release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/07/09/1880451/0/en/NJIT-to-Establish-New-Institute-for-Data-Science.html):

> The institute will bring together scientists, engineers and users to develop data-driven technologies and apply them to solve fundamental and real-world problems. Beyond academic research, the institute will interact closely with the outside world to identify and solve important problems in the modern data-driven economy.

In October 2016, CRA released a [statement](https://cra.org/data-science/) on computing research and the emerging field of data science.
