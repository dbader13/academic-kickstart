The New Jersey Institute of Technology has announced that it will establish a new Institute for Data Science, directed by Distinguished Professor **David Bader**. Bader recently joined NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing from Georgia Tech, where he was chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Computing. Bader was recognized as one of HPCwire’s People to Watch in 2014.

“Complementing our new facility in Jersey City, which will focus on data science training, NJIT is making significant investments in technological R&D to drive the new AI economy,” said Fadi P. Deek, provost and senior executive vice president of NJIT. “The new institute is a key step in that direction. I cannot think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Bader to lead the new institute and we are fortunate to have him join us.”
