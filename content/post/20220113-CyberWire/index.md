A White House government-industry summit today addresses open-source software security. The US officially makes its second attribution of the week to a nation-state: it calls out Iran as the operator of the MuddyWater threat group. Israel arrests five on charges related to spying for Iran (theyâ€™re thought to have been recruited through catphishing). Citizen Lab finds Pegasus in Salvadoran phones. Ukraine arrests a ransomware gang. Thomas Etheridge from CrowdStrike on the importance of threat hunting for zero days. Our guest is **Dr. David Bader** of New Jersey Institute of Technology discussing the challenges of securing massive-scale analytics. And ransomware hits US state and local governments.
