The ACM this week announced NJIT **Distinguished Professor David Bader** in its new class of Fellows.

Bader [received the honor](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/january/fellows-2021) along with 70 peers in the computing industry, representing just 1 percent of Association for Computing Machinery membership.

"The contributions of the 2021 Fellows run the gamut of the computing field — including cloud database systems, deep learning acceleration, high performance computing, robotics, and theoretical computer science," ACM President Gabriele Kotsis stated.

"I reflect on the citation 'for contributions to high-performance computing systems, graph analytics, and technical leadership in parallel computing',” Bader said. "I am grateful for the computing community giving me the opportunity to serve our field throughout the years, including as Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing," he added.

Bader developed [a Linux supercomputer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546947) and connected it to the National Science Foundation's National Technology Grid. That accomplishment was cited by the IEEE Computer Society last fall in awarding him the Sidney Fernbach award, "for the development of Linux-based massively parallel production computers and for pioneering contributions to scalable discrete parallel algorithms for real-world applications."

Bader is also known as a leader in scalable graph analytics. Today, virtually all supercomputers run Linux, while scalable graph analytics has become a mainstream application in fields such as cybersecurity and healthcare.

He's currently working on making supercomputer power [available to everyone](https://news.njit.edu/institute-data-science-aims-democratize-supercomputing-nsf-grant) and is developing new standards for [streaming data analytics](https://news.njit.edu/streaming-data-analytics-has-new-method-planned-njit-usc-harvard).

Bader leads NJIT's [Institute for Data Science](https://datascience.njit.edu/) and teaches in Ying Wu College of Computing.

"Dr. Bader is an internationally known expert and leader in the area of computer architecture and optimization. This is a very well-deserved honor and great recognition," said NJIT's Atam Dhawan, senior vice provost for research. "We are very proud of his continued accomplishments and many significant contributions to the scientific community and NJIT."
