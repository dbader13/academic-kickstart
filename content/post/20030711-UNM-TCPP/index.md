**David A. Bader**, an associate professor and Regents’ Lecturer in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of New Mexico, has been elected chair of the IEEE Computer Society’s Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP). 

He will serve a two-year term that began on July 1. The TCPP acts as an international forum to promote parallel processing research and education, and participates in setting up technical standards in the area. 

“New Mexico, well-known for its high performance computing research and some of the fastest computers in the world, is a great place from which to promote parallel, distributed, high performance computing education, research and technology,” said Bader. “I am honored to serve the international community.

“UNM is well situated for this interest. We manage the world class Center for High Performance Computing, are lead investigators on several highly competitive National Science Foundation Information Technology Research projects and are partners with IBM in developing a revolutionary high-end computing platform under the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems program.”

Of interest are issues related to the design, analysis and implementation of parallel systems and solutions, including design and analysis of parallel architectures and algorithms and application development on parallel machines. TCPP sponsors professional meetings, releases publications, sets guidelines for educational programs and coordinates academia, funding agency and industry activities in these areas. 

The International Parallel and Distributed Processing  Symposium (IPDPS), held annually in the spring in locations such as Nice, France (2003), Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (2002), San Francisco, Calif. (2001) and Cancun, Mexico (2000), will be held at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe in April 2004. Bader will co-chair and UNM will host the meeting that serves as the flagship activity of TCPP. Several workshops spanning interdisciplinary areas are also sponsored by committee.

Bader received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1996 from the University of Maryland and was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Research Associateship in Experimental Computer Science before joining UNM in 1998.  

He is an NSF CAREER Award recipient, an investigator on six NSF awards including three ITR awards, a distinguished speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitors Program, and is a member of the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems program. 

Bader serves on the steering committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences, and is the general co-chair for IPDPS (2004-2005) and vice general chair for HiPC (2002-2003). He has served on numerous conference program committees related to parallel processing, is an associate editor for the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics in the area of parallel algorithms, senior member of the IEEE Computer Society and a member of the ACM.

Bader has given several keynote talks and lectures on high-performance computing for problems in computational genomics.  He has co-authored more than 40 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. His main areas of research are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and computational biology and genomics.
