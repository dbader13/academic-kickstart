More than [half a billion customers](https://www.njherald.com/videos/money/2024/05/31/ticketmaster-customers-personal-info-credit-card-numbers-hacked-reports-say/73909301007/) at the event ticketing company Ticketmaster had their personal information hacked and potentially sold on the dark web last month, but security experts say there are measures you can take to minimize the impact.  

The data includes credit card details, names and addresses, with the hacking group ShinyHunters reportedly claiming responsibility for the breach. They are seeking a ransom payment of $500,000 to prevent the data from being sold. 

“That may run up your credit and it may be used in other countries to buy weapons, it may be used on the dark web, and so it’s very important to protect your identity and your credit information,” said **David Bader**, a professor at the Ying Wu College of Computing at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

Ticketmaster, which is owned by  Live Nation Entertainment, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Live Nation confirmed in a [May 20 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525824000081/lyv-20240520.htm) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a “criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be company user data for sale via the dark web.”

## Alert your credit card company ##

There are “general hygiene” security measures people can take to protect their data, said Raffi Jamgotchian, founding CEO of Triada Networks, an IT security firm based in Norwood. 

Odysseas Papadimitriou, a former executive at credit card company Capital One, said to monitor activity on any cards tied to your Ticketmaster account.

Bader, the NJIT professor, said that if you suspect your information was compromised by the Ticketmaster data breach, then you have the option to contact your credit card provider. They might provide a replacement card. 

## Monitor your credit reports ##

Papadimitriou, who’s now CEO of personal finance website [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/), said that you can sign up for round-the-clock credit monitoring.

There are three agencies that monitor your credit report: TransUnion, Experian and Equifax.

## Don't overshare information ##

“The more information a bad actor has on you, the more easy it is for them to assume your identity and, for instance, get credit issued in your name,” said Bader.

Even information as basic as your birthday can be misused, Bader said. 

Papadimitriou said to never respond to “unexpected requests for information,” especially over the phone. 

“No legitimate financial institution or service provider would call you up and ask for your personal identifying information,” Bader said. 

Though if you are called, you should notify your service provider, as you might not be the only person affected and the provider “may be under an attack,” he added.

## Protect your login information ##

One option is multi-factor authentication. That’s when you use your mobile phone to authenticate your identity when logging in, whether through a “pop up, a generated code or a text message,” said Jamgotchian of Triada. 

Papadimitriou said you should also update your Ticketmaster password.
