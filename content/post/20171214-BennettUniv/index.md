NEW DELHI: [Bennett University](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bennett-University)'s computer science and engineering (CSE) department
held its first international conference on machine learning and data science at its Greater
Noida campus that saw researchers and academicians deliberating on the new wave of
technologies and their impact on the world of big data, machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI).

The two-day conference was organised by the department in association with the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society. Bennett University has
been set up by the Times Group, which publishes ET.

"We are pleased to be in India to establish a relationship with all the major universities
including Bennett University, so that we can develop and nurture the relationship such that
India becomes a very important player in the computer society," said Roger Fujii, 2016
president of the society.

The event saw attendance from 50 organisations including IBM, Nvidia, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Accenture, Dell and Infosys,
among others. Also attending were about 400 participants representing premier institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology,
National Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi Technological University,
University of Delhi, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology and Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur.

**David A Bader**, professor and chair, School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, and professor
Inderjit S Dhillon of the University of Texas delivered keynote addresses that highlighted cutting-edge research in the areas of data
science and AI. Bennett University vice-chancellor Yaj Medury opened the conference.

The conference coincided with the recent MoU signed between Bennett University and Nvidia, making it the first educational institute in

the country to get the DGX-1V100 AI supercomputer.

"This conference is a key milestone in our quest to be a leader in computer engineering research and education," said CSE head
Deepak Garg. "It provided us with phenomenal outreach for our prospective collaborators as well as industry connect."
