Dear **Dr. Bader**,

I would like to thank you for your service as a member of the NSF Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure (ACCI) from 2014 thru 2017. As you are aware, NSF has assumed a leadership role in the development and support of a comprehesive cyberinfrastructure essential to 21st century advances in science and engineering research and education. This can only occur with contributions such as yours. Your contribution as a member of the ACCI has provided valuable perspective and advice on the Foundation's plans and strategic directions for cyberinfrastructure as well as important contact with the science and engineering community and other stakeholders impacted by our cyberinfrastructure portfolio.

The NSF relies heavily on close interactions with the science and engineering communities. We serve and seek advice through a number of mechanisms, including advisory committees, taskforces, working groups, and workshops. I hope you will consider helping us again in the future when the occasion arises. Your continuing interest and input will certainly be appreciated.

Sincerely,

James Kurose   
Assistant Director, CISE

Irene Qualters   
Office Director, OAC
