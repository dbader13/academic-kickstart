The Computer Science and Engineering Department (CSE) of Bennett University organised its first International Conference on Machine learning and Data Science, at the University campus, in Greater Noida. Touted as the biggest conference in this space, the conference will further boost India’s crucial leap in embracing the AI revolution. The conference witnessed an overwhelming response from organizations, researchers and academicians. There were thought provoking deliberations on the new wave of technologies and their impact in the world of big data, machine learning and AI. The two-day conference was organised by CSE in association with IEEE Computer Society.

The conference was inaugurated by Roger Fujii, IEEE Computer Society President (2016). Speaking on the vision of IEEE for India Fujii said “India is a vital part in our future of membership and technology growth in the field of computing. We are pleased to be in India to establish a relationship with all the major Universities including Bennett University, so that we can develop and nurture the relationship such that India becomes a very important player in the computer society”.

The event saw a footfall of Over 50 Organizations – IBM, NVIDIA, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, DELL and Infosys, to name a few. Around 400 participants representing premier institutions from all over India like IITs, NIT, IIMs, JNU, DTU, DU, KIIT UNIVERSITY, and MNIT Jaipur were present.

**David A. Bader** – Professor and Chair, School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Professor Inderjit S Dhillon – University of Texas delivered key note addresses that highlighted cutting edge research in the area of data science and AI. Dr. Yaj Medury – Vice Chancellor, Bennett University opened the conference welcoming the delegates and Dr Suneet Tuli – Dean, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences delivered the vote of thanks.

The conference also coincides with the recent MoU signed between Bennett University and technology giant NVIDIA, which places the varsity as the first educational institute in the country to get DGX-1 V100 AI super computer. Following this, the CSE department of the university has designed a specialised curriculum to include deep learning – a type of machine-learning method that will facilitate to provide solutions to some of the unsolved societal problems in the realm of Healthcare & Pharma, smart cities, automotive industry and also in the search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence.

Speaking at the event, Dr. Deepak Garg, Head – CSE, Bennett University said “This conference is a key milestone in our quest to be a leader in Computer Engineering research and education. We have got the requisite gravitas by attracting quality faculty and embracing Innovative learning pedagogy for the Internet generation. This conference provided us with phenomenal outreach for our prospective collaborators, Industry connect. Participants were really impressed with our unparalleled computing infrastructure, interdisciplinary projects and student achievements”.

**Professor Bader**’s Keynote on Massive – Scale Streaming Analytics delved on providing a solution to real-world challenges ranging from healthcare, informatics to cyber security. He elaborated on how predictive methods is capable of making accurate business decisions. Addressing a gap in the education sector and talent for a trained workforce in machine learning, Bader emphasised that “Nearly every sector that has data can benefit from Machine Learning and Data Science. It will be wise for Institutions globally to take advantage of the myriad possibilities that Machine Learning has to offer and design a curriculum around new approaches that will help in augmenting the workforce required for implementing technologies”.

Aditya Chaudhuri, M.D – Communication, Media and Technology at Accenture hosted an exclusive lunch for key delegates, to further the discussion on future technologies. Avant-garde workshops, live demos from IBM on their machine learning applications on Watson and AR/VR (Augmented reality/Virtual reality) demo on holodeck station from NVIDIA were also some of the key highlights of the conference.
