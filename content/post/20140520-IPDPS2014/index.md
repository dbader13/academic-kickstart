Georgia Tech is putting forth a dominating presence at one of the premier parallel computation symposia this week in Phoenix as it sends 30 of its professors and researchers to present nine papers, two of which earned “best paper” honors.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), held from May 19 to 23 in Phoenix, is the flagship activity of the IEEE Computer Society’s Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP), representing a unique international gathering of computer scientists from around the world.

For IPDPS 2014, Georgia Tech participates in virtually every part of the technical program, where researchers from the College of Computing and the Institute for Data and High Performance Computing (IDH) have gathered to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. They will take part in numerous paper presentations, workshops, and other parts of the 28th annual IPDPS program. **David A. Bader** serves as the 2014 IPDPS program chair, and Srinivas Aluru has been tapped as the program chair for the 2015 symposium.

This year, Georgia Tech researchers—CSE’s Associate Professor Edmond Chow and graduate students Xing Liu and Aftab Patel, and CS’s Associate Professor Santosh Pande and graduate student Kaushik Ravichandran—took home two of the four best paper awards given at IPDPS 2014.

Georgia Tech’s participation at IPDPS 2014 includes:
