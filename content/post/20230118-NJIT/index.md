NJIT’s dean of Ying Wu College of Computing, Craig Gotsman, is among 57 researchers worldwide named as a [2022 Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/january/fellows-2022), the leading global organization for computing research.

The ACM Fellows program, [since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fellows_of_the_Association_for_Computing_Machinery#1994), recognizes the top 1% of ACM members annually for their outstanding accomplishments in computing and information technology, as well as or service to ACM and the larger computing community. These individuals have made significant contributions in topics across the spectrum of computing, including algorithms, data science, graphics, cybersecurity, mobile and networked systems and other technological fields in daily use.

Gotsman, a Distinguished Professor at NJIT, was cited for his contributions to computer graphics, geometry processing and visual computing. His research focuses on 3D computer graphics, geometry processing, animation and computational geometry. He made influential contributions, both theoretical and applied, in 3D compression, mesh parameterization, shape deformation methods and video processing.

Publishing more than 170 research papers, he won eight best paper awards at leading conferences and mentored more than 50 postgraduate students at the masters, doctoral and postdoctoral levels. Among his contributions are 3D coding algorithms incorporated into the MPEG-4 standard.

"I am honored to be named an ACM Fellow," Gotsman said. "Coming from the leading professional organization in my field, this is a significant distinction, and it is extremely satisfying to have my work recognized in this way."

"Computing’s most important advances are often the result of a collection of many individual contributions, which build upon and complement each other," explained ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. "But each individual contribution is an essential link in the chain. The ACM Fellows program is a way to recognize the women and men whose hard work and creativity happens inconspicuously but drives our field."

Gotsman holds multiple US patents, is a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors and a member of the Academy of Europe (Academia Europae). He is also the co-founder of three startup companies, two based on his academic research, the most recent developing 3D video processing technologies which was  acquired by Apple in 2017.

An induction ceremony will take place at the ACM annual meeting in June in San Francisco. Gotsman is NJIT's second inductee, following **Distinguished Professor David Bader** [last year](https://news.njit.edu/david-bader-earns-acm-fellow-status-career-data-science-and-supercomuting).
