For the 87th year, Sigma Xi presents its panel of Distinguished Lecturers as an opportunity for chapters to host visits from outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science.  These experts have agreed to visit chapters and share their insights and excitement on the topics detailed below.

The Distinguished Lecturers are available from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026. Each speaker has consented to a modest honorarium together with full payment of travel costs and subsistence.

Local chapters may apply for subsidies to support expenses related to hosting a Distinguished Lecturer. Subsidy applications must be submitted online by March 1, 2025, for funds to be available in the next fiscal year.

Additional support for the program comes from the American Meteorological Society. Lecturer biographies, contact information, and additional details can be found online at sigmaxi/lectureships or by sending an email to [lectureships@sigmaxi.org](mailto:lectureships@sigmaxi.org).
