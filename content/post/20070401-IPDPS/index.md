**David A. Bader**, Executive Director of High-Performance Computing, and Associate Professor in the Computational Science and Engineering Division of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, recently delivered a keynote talk on “Petascale Computing for Large-Scale Graph Problems“ at the 8th IEEE International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Scientific and Engineering Computing (PDSEC), on March 30 in Long Beach, CA, held in conjunction with the 21st IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS).

“Graph theoretic problems are representative of fundamental kernels in traditional and emerging computational sciences such as chemistry, biology, and medicine, as well as applications in national security,” said Bader, “Yet they pose serious challenges for parallel machines due to non-contiguous, concurrent accesses to global data structures with low degrees of locality. We consider several graph theoretic kernels for connectivity and centrality and discuss how the features of petascale architectures will affect algorithm development, ease of programming, performance, and scalability.”

IPDPS is considered the premier academic conference in the areas of parallel and distributed computing.  This year's symposium held from March 26-30 in Long Beach, CA, was met with record attendance with over 650 attendees and included 109 peer-reviewed papers in its highly-competitive main track, four keynote talks and over 20 workshops. Being highly regarded by the professional community as the annual meeting for top research results in the field, IPDPS had strong international participation with approximately equal attendance from the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The College of Computing had strong participation at the symposium, with 20 activities related to the College:
