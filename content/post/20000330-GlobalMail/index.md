IBM is launching a new class of low-cost supercomputers that use the Linux operating system, allowing researchers and developers access to computational power that they previously couldn't afford.

The National Computational Science Alliance, comprised of 50 academic, government and research partners, says it will use the system as a part of its effort to create a new, highly sophisticated computer network for research.

The system, called Los Lobos, is actually a supercluster of 256 PC servers (powerful computers that manage networks of other computers) that will be located at the University of New Mexico.
