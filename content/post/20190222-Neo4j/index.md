[![Solving Real-World Problems: 5-Minute Interview with David Bader, Professor at Georgia Tech](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ouwh5ed5SdU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouwh5ed5SdU)

When **David Bader** started working with graphs 25 years ago, it was a niche that required designing specific algorithms and even specific computers. Now the Neo4j graph database is used widely by analysts and researchers who work with Georgia Tech, rapidly asking questions and visualizing results. 

In this weekâ€™s five-minute interview (conducted at GraphConnect 2018 in NYC), we spoke with **Dr. Bader** about using graph technology to solve real-world problems, including a knowledge graph to track emerging problems and threats.
