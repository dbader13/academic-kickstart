In 2011, [The University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/)'s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering established the **Distinguished Alumni Award** to recognize alumni who have made significant and meritorious contributions to their fields. Alumni are nominated by their advising professors or the department chair, and the Department Council then approves their selection. In early May, the faculty and staff gather to honor the recipients at a luncheon.

**Dr. David Bader** was inducted in the inaugural 2012 class of distinguished alumni.

2012: **Dr. David Bader**, Professor
