IBM Corp. said it’s providing a new class of low-cost supercomputer that uses the Linux alternative operating system, allowing researchers and developers access to computational power they previously could not afford. The National Computational Science Alliance, made up of 50 academic, government and research partners, said it would use the system of IBM computers as a part of its effort to create a new, highly sophisticated computer network for research. The system, called Los Lobos, is actually a “supercluster” of servers acting as one to process at a speed of 375 gigaflops, or 375 billion operations per second. It will be located at the **University of New Mexico**.
