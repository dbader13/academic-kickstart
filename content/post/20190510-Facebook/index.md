In January, Facebook invited university faculty to respond to a [call for research proposals on AI System Hardware/Software Co-Design](https://research.fb.com/programs/research-awards/proposals/ai-system-hardware-software-co-design-request-for-proposals/). Co-design implies simultaneous design and optimization of several aspects of the system, including hardware and software, to achieve a set target for a given system metric, such as throughput, latency, power, size, or any combination thereof. Deep learning has been particularly amenable to such co-design processes across various parts of the software and hardware stack, leading to a variety of novel algorithms, numerical optimizations, and AI hardware.

Facebook AI teams have also been using co-design to develop high-performance AI solutions for existing as well as future AI hardware. Through these research awards, we looked to support further exploration of co-design opportunities across a number of new dimensions.

We received 88 submissions, many of which provided promising research direction. The selection committee was composed of 10 engineers representing a wide range of AI hardware/algorithm co-design research areas.
