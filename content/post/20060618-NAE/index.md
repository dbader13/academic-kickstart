WASHINGTON — Eighty-three of the nation's brightest young engineers have been selected to take part in the National
Academy of Engineering's (NAE) 13th annual U.S. Frontiers of Engineering symposium. The 2½-day event will bring together
engineers ages 30 to 45 who are performing exceptional engineering research and technical work in a variety of disciplines.
The participants — from industry, academia, and government — were nominated by fellow engineers or organizations and
chosen from more than 260 applicants.

"It is exciting to witness the energy when outstanding engineers from many different fields come together in this unique
venue," said NAE President Wm. A. Wulf. "Frontiers of Engineering is a proven mechanism for traversing engineering
disciplines. By exposing bright young minds to developments in areas other than their own — and giving them lots of time to
interact — Frontiers enables advances in approaches and thinking that would not have occurred otherwise."

The symposium will be held Sept. 24-26 at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash., and will examine trustworthy computer
systems, safe water technologies, modeling and simulating human behavior, biotechnology for fuels and chemicals, and the
control of protein conformations. Dr. Henrique Malvar, Microsoft Distinguished Engineer and managing director, Microsoft
Research, will be a featured speaker. His research at Microsoft has focused on audio and video signal enhancement and
compression, multirate signal processing, and signal decompositions. Prior to joining Microsoft Research, Malvar headed
research and advanced technology at PictureTel and the Digital Signal Processing Research Group at Universidade de
Brasília.

The National Academy of Engineering is an independent, nonprofit institution that serves as an adviser to government and the
public on issues in engineering and technology. Its members consist of the nation's premier engineers, who are elected by
their peers for their distinguished achievements. Established in 1964, NAE operates under the congressional charter granted
to the National Academy of Sciences in 1863.
