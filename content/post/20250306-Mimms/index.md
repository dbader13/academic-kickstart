Revolutionized the computing industry through groundbreaking innovations that democratized High-Performance Computing. Designed the first commodity-based supercomputer and prototyped a system using off-the-shelf components and a novel high-speed interconnection network, leading to “RoadRunner,” the first Linux supercomputer for open use by the national science and engineering community. Made seminal contributions to parallel computing software and pioneered general-purpose computing on accelerators. Led the team whose work was by used IBM in the first pre-assembled and configured Linux server clusters for business. Made significant research contributions in the field of novel parallel graph algorithms. Founded and chaired the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.
