**David A. Bader** and Joseph Ja'Ja' have released a
technical report entitled "SIMPLE: A Methodology for Programming High
Performance Algorithms on Clusters of Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMPs),"
Technical Report Number: CS-TR-3798 and UMIACS-TR-97-48. Institute for
Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), University of Maryland, College
Park, May 1997.

  The report describes a methodology for developing high performance programs
running on clusters of SMP nodes. The methodology is based on a small kernel
(SIMPLE) of collective communication primitives that make efficient use of
the hybrid shared and message passing environment. The power of the
methodology is illustrated by presentation of experimental results for
sorting integers, two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms (FFT), and
constraint-satisfied searching. The testbed is a cluster of DEC AlphaServer
2100 4 / 275 nodes interconnected by an ATM switch.
