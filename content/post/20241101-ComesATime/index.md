**David A. Bader** is a Distinguished Professor and founder of the Department of Data Science in the Ying Wu College of Computing and Director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Prior to this, he served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology. Bader is an elected Board Member of the Computing Research Association (CRA). He is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and SIAM; a recipient of the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award; and the 2022 Innovation Hall of Fame inductee of the University of Marylandâ€™s A. James Clark School of Engineering. The Computer History Museum recognizes Bader for developing the first Linux-based supercomputer which became the predominant architecture for all major supercomputers in the world.  Bader followed the Grateful Dead during their heyday, immersing himself in the counterculture movement. As a member of the Legion of the Sufficiently Twisted (LOST), an offshoot of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, he embarked on wild adventures that shaped his unique perspective on life. Alongside John Perry Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and an early internet pioneer, Bader experienced memorable escapades that bridged the worlds of technology, music, and freedom of expression.
