Electrical and computer engineering alum **David Bader ’90 ’91G** has been named a Fellow of ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery. 

A Distinguished Professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Bader is one of 71 top innovators recognized in the 2021 class of ACM Fellows. He is also founder of NJIT's Department of Data Science and inaugural director of its Institute for Data Science.

He earned his BS in electrical engineering from Lehigh in 1990 and his MS in computer engineering in 1991. 

Bader was recognized "for contributions to high-performance computing systems, graph analytics, and technical leadership in parallel computing."

"I am grateful for the computing community giving me the opportunity to serve our field throughout the years, including as Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing," says Bader, in a story published by NJIT.
