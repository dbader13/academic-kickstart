In a post on LinkedIn, **Dr. David A. Bader**, Distinguished Professor and Director, Institute for Data Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote, "*Through rigorous research and innovative design, Oliver developed a framework that democratizes large-scale exploratory graph analytics for both developers and users. His work has been successfully applied in diverse scientific domains including scientometrics, cybersecurity, and neuroscience.*"

Congratulations Dr. Alvarado Rodriguez! Tri-County is very proud to have been a part of your educational journey.

Oliver's journey:


Oliver and his family immigrated from Costa Rica. His father was a part-time custodian for Blessed Sacrament School in Paterson where Oliver went to elementary school with the help of Tri-County Scholarship Fund. Oliver then qualified for the Tri-County Freedom Scholarship to attend DePaul Catholic High School where he continued to excel and graduated in 2016.


With a strong academic foundation from his hardwork at the excellent Tri-County partner schools that he attended, Oliver was admitted to the Honors College at William Paterson University, where he majored in computer science and minored in mathematics. While pursuing his under graduate degree, Tri-County facilitated his connection with Chubb Insurance where he was offered a summer intership in data science.

> Said Oliver, “Tri-County not only gave me the opportunity to receive an excellent education that I would not have gotten out of the Paterson school system, but also the connections to land a data science internship at Chubb Insurance in college. I’m so thankful for the opportunities Tri-County afforded me and how I have been able to grow since then.

Further congratulations to Oliver on having been offered a position at Hewlett Packard. Can't wait to see what the future holds!
