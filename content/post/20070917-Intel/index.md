"Multi-core is a disruptive technology — and I mean that in a good
way — because it’s only when you have disruption of the status
quo that new innovations can affect technology with revolutionary
advances,” says **David A. Bader**, executive director of high-performance
computing at Georgia Tech. Software developers who optimize
their code for this groundbreaking technology can deliver new levels of functionality
more cost-effectively. However, to achieve this optimization they’ll
need to tap into a new set of resources. “Making the most of multi-core systems
will require new tools, new algorithms and new ways of looking at programming,”
says Bader. Advanced visual software tools are helping developers balance
workload among all cores and consolidate more features and horsepower within
a smaller form factor.
