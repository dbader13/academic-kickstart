Speakers at TEDxNJIT 2021 will explain how technology impacts everything from knee-replacement surgery and the monitoring of traumatic brain injuries to how we’ll live in the wake of the global pandemic.

Other speakers — including leaders from the Federal Aviation Administration and Los Alamos National Laboratory — will mull commercial space exploration, equitable economic growth, entrepreneurship, epidemic forecasting and the role of immigrants in developing vaccines for COVID-19 — all in under 18 minutes. The theme of [this year’s TEDxNJIT](https://tedxnjit.com/) — the university’s 11th — is resurgence.

“The organizing committee thought that resurgence was appropriate for the year when the world was emerging from the pandemic,” explained Raja Roy, chair of the committee and an assistant professor at NJIT’s [Martin Tuchman School of Management](https://management.njit.edu/). “It was also sufficiently broad and gave speakers the liberty to design their talk based on resurgence in their field.”

The event will take place online Sept. 22 from 6 to 8 p.m. It’s free but you need to register in advance here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tedxnjit-2021-tickets-159181525227. More than half of the speakers are connected to NJIT. Here’s a closer look at their credentials and talks.
