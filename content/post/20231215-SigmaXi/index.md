For the 86th year, Sigma Xi presents its panel of Distinguished Lecturers as an opportunity for chapters to host visits from outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science.  These vistors communicate their insights and excitement on a broad range of topics.

The Distinguished Lecturers are available form July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Each speaker has consented to a modest honorariuam together with full payment of travel costs and subsistence.

Local chapters may apply for subsidies to support expenses related to hosting a Distinguished Lecturer. Applications must be submitted online by March 1, 2024, for funds to be available the next fiscal year.

Additional support for the program comes from the American Meteorological Society. Lecturer biographies, contact information, and additional details can be found online at sigmaxi.org/lectureships or by sending an email to lectureships@sigmaxi.org

David A. Bader is a Distinguished Professor and founder of the Department of Data Science and inaugural Director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Prior to this, he served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology.

Dr. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and SIAM, and a recipient of the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award. He advises the White House, most recently on the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem (FACE). Bader is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. His interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing and real-world applications, including cybersecurity, massive-scale analytics, and computational genomics, and he has co-authored over 300 scholarly papers and has best paper awards from ISC, IEEE HPEC, and IEEE/ACM SC.

Dr. Bader is Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing, and previously served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. ROI-NJ recognized Bader as a technology influencer on its 2021 inaugural and 2022 lists. In 2012, Bader was the inaugural recipient of University of Maryland’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Distinguished Alumni Award.

In 2014, Bader received the Outstanding Senior Faculty Research Award from Georgia Tech. Bader has also served as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor and Director of an NVIDIA GPU Center of Excellence. In 1998, Bader built the first Linux supercomputer that led to a high-performance computing (HPC) revolution, and Hyperion Research estimates that the total economic value of Linux supercomputing pioneered by Bader has been over $100 trillion over the past 25 years.
