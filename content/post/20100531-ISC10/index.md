'Life Sciences' is becoming a strategic discipline at the frontier between
Molecular Biology and Computer Science, impacting medicine,
biotechnology, as well as society. 'Life Sciences', the leading edge
research is one of the most challenging supercomputer application for
the future. At ISC’10 we will organize a special session about 'Life
Sciences', to fulfill the growing interest from the public and the
scientific world.

'Computational Life Sciences' is fast emerging as an important
discipline for academic research and industrial application. The large
size of biological data sets, inherent complexity of biological problems
and the ability to deal with error-prone data all result in large run-time
and memory requirements. This session will provide a forum for
discussion of latest research (from world-class speakers and reputed
researchers in the field) in developing high-performance computing
solutions to problems arising from molecular biology.

'Life Sciences' span a whole set of research topics to better understand
how the components of complex living systems interact and give rise to
life and how their malfunction causes disease. The use of HPC is clearly
a must and future progress and development in this field is only
possible if supercomputers are heavily involved.

Chair: **David A. Bader**, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology &
Matthias Rarey, Professor, University of Hamburg
