Determining our first-ever ROI Influencers: Technology list was a process that followed our traditional format: We spoke to approximately a dozen New Jersey tech leaders (all of whom are on the list) to get their takes on various categories. 

Defining the list? That wasn’t as easy.

It starts with the founders — those who have created the cool and innovative companies that dot the state. But it wouldn’t be complete without the investors that helped many of them grow, the academics who are mentoring and inspiring the next generation, the executives of tech companies that give the state such a rich ecosystem and the thought leaders that help bring everyone together.

Our Top 10 list brings together the best in all of these categories.

We’re overwhelmed with the quality of honorees on the list — and humbled to know that there are many others out there deserving of the recognition. We’re confident this list will only grow each year.
