## Memorandum ##
 
Date:     April 25, 2023  
From:    Atam P Dhawan, Senior Vice Provost for Research  
RE:        Announcement: NJIT FY2024 Faculty Seed Grant Award Winners  
 
The faculty and student success are the strategic priorities in the NJIT Strategic Plan. Increasing external funding with collaborative synergy and partnerships for basic, applied and translational research is one of the strategic objectives to enable enhanced faculty and student success and professional development.  The purpose of the NJIT Faculty Seed Grant (FSG) initiative is to promote collaborative research in the core and interdisciplinary areas by providing seed funding to obtain preliminary results for developing future grant proposals for submission to external funding agencies. The FSG initiative specifically seeks seed funding proposals from faculty to launch new initiatives in core, collaborative and interdisciplinary emerging areas aligned with NJIT strategic tactics to develop critical research mass. It is expected that the FSG funds will be used to promote on-campus collaborative seed research with faculty and students.
 
We are very pleased to announce 28 FY24 Faculty Seed Grant awards this year.
 
Congratulations to all FY24 Faculty Seed Grant Winners!
