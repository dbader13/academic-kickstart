**New Jersey Institute of Technology** is creating a center that will conduct basic and applied research focusing on interdisciplinary research and development for all areas pertaining to digital data.

The Institute of Data Science, unveiled July 9, will be led by **David Bader**, a distinguished professor at NJIT.

At the institute, scientists, engineers and users will develop technologies applicable in the “real world,” NJIT said, working beyond academic research to solve “problems in the modern data-driven economy.” It will combine existing centers from across the university’s colleges and schools in big data, medical informatics and cybersecurity with new centers in data analytics and artificial intelligence.

“Complementing our new facility in Jersey City, which will focus on data science training, NJIT is making significant investments in technological R&D to drive the new AI economy,” NJIT Provost and Senior Executive Vice President Fadi Deek said in a  statement. “The new institute is a key step in that direction.

“I cannot think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Bader to lead the new institute and we are fortunate to have him join us,” he added.

A member of NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing, Bader recently arrived from Georgia Tech where he chaired the School of Computational Science and Engineering, a part of the College of Computing.

At Georgia Tech, Bader successfully launched the Strategic Partnership Program, with members including leading technology companies and national government laboratories. He has co-authored more than 230 articles in peer-reviewed journals and is a fellow of the IEEE, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also served on the White House’s Strategic Computing Initiative panel.
