Attendees of SC2002 will be treated to a thought-provoking set of panel
discussions on topics from homeland security to innovations in high-end
computing to the impact of the Earth Simulator, the world's fastest
supercomputer. This year's conference, with the theme "From Terabytes to
Insights," will convene Nov. 16-22 at the Baltimore Convention Center.

Some of the best-known experts in the field will lead the discussions on
significant questions and major accomplishments in high performance computing,
including:

* High End Information Technology Requirements for Homeland Security.    
Panelists: Chaitan Baru, University of California, San Diego; Cray Henry,
Larry Davis, DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program; Russ
Graves, MITRE; Joe Picciano, FEMA; Ted Senator, DARPA Information Awareness
Office    
Panelists will discuss the role of HPC resources in homeland security,
including: managing large, heterogeneous databases; balancing the need for
information sharing and security; and molecular dynamics simulations as
countermeasures to biological threats.

* Planning for a Homeland Security Research Agenda    
Panelists: Paul Rosenbloom, University of Southern California Information
Sciences Institute; Tom DeFanti, University of Illinois at Chicago; Stephen
Squires, Hewlett Packard; Lee Holcomb, U.S. Office of Homeland Security;
Art L. Money, consultant; Peter Freeman, National Science Foundation
Experts will examine the issues involved in developing a long-term research
and development agenda for homeland security using ideas from recent
workshops, emerging industrial technologies, defense department
experiences, and academia.

* The 40 Tflop/s Earth Simulator System: Its Impact on the Future
Development of Supercomputing    
Panelists: David Bader, DOE Office of Biological and Environmental
Research; David Kahaner, Asian Technology Information Program, Tokyo;
Burton Smith, Cray, Inc.; Hisashi Nakamura, Research Organization for
Information Science & Technology, Tokyo.    
This panel will look beyond the initial excitement over the introduction of
the Earth Simulator System, the world's fastest computer, to the possible
scientific advantages that could be gained from such a huge performance
leap and the possible impact of ESS on commodity-based supercomputers.

* HPCS: Achieving high-end computing productivity    
Panelists: Marty Deneroff, SGI; Mootaz Elnozahy, IBM; Richard Kaufmann,
Hewlett Packard; Richard Games, MITRE; Burton Smith, Cray, Inc.; Danny
Cohen, Sun Microsystems Inc.    
Participants will discuss the High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS)
Program, initiated by DARPA to bring a broad spectrum of innovative
technologies and architectures into DoD computing systems.

* Computational biology and high performance computing    
Panelists: Chris Johnson, University of Utah; John Reynders, Celera; **David
Bader**, University of New Mexico; Debra Goldfarb, IDC; Rick Stevens,
Argonne National Laboratory/ University of Chicago    
Bioinformatics, genomics, and other biological sciences promise to more
than double the size of the high performance computing market. This panel
will discuss HPC strategies for solving biological and biomedical problems.

* Truth and Consequences: The Making of Discovery Channel's "Unfolding
Universe"    
Panelists: Tom Lucas , Tom Lucas Productions, Inc.; Ed Seidel, Max Planck
Institute; Neil Tyson, American Museum of Natural History; Michael Norman,
University of California, San Diego; Robert Patterson, NCSA    
The Discovery Channel documentary "Unfolding Universe" includes extensive
astronomy, astrophysics, computational science and scientific visualizations.
This panel promises a lively discussion/debate on how to best present
science to the general public.

* Are Designer Supercomputers an Endangered Species?    
Panelists: Thomas Sterling, Center for Advanced Computing Research,
California Institute of Technology; Gita Alaghband, University of Colorado,
Denver; Jamshed Mirza, IBM; Tadaski Watanabe, NEC; Candace Culhane, NSA.    
Will the emergence of Components Off-the-Shelf (COTS) clusters and
distributed computing projects lead to the end of custom-designed machines?
Or will the new Earth Simulator System result in a resurgence of
specialized vector machines?

* Desktop Grids: 10,000-fold Parallelism for the Masses    
Panelists: Kim Baldridge, San Diego Supercomputer Center; David Ceperley,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Andrew Chien, University of
California at San Diego; David Dixon, Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory; John Reynders, Celera    
Internet distributed computing projects have used hundreds of thousands of
processors to solve problems and may represent a breakthrough technology.
Panelists will explore how to accelerate the use of distributed desktop grids.

SC2002, the annual high performance networking and computing conference,
brings together scientists, engineers, educators, visualization artists,
programmers, and business leaders to share ideas and glimpse the future of
high performance networking and computing, data analysis and management,
visualization, and computational modeling. SC2002 is sponsored by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society and by
the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on
Computer Architecture.
