Even though the library community is focusing on Linux for small systems, IBM has introduced a supercomputer that uses the Linux operating system. The system, called Los Lobos, is a super-cluster of servers and consists of 256 IBM Netfinity PC servers, which are linked using special clustering software and high-speed networking hardware acting as one to process at a speed of 375 gigaflops. That makes it the 24th most powerful computer in the world. The National Computational Science Alliance, a consortium of 50 academic and research entities, plans to use Los Lobos to create a new computer network for research.
