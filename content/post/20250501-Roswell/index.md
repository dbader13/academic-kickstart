## A Night of Innovation, Recognition, and Transformation ##

The Computer Museum of America has entered a bold new era, officially rebranding as the Mimms Museum of Technology and Art. To announce this came with BYTE25, the museum's signature fundraiser, which celebrated innovation and legacy, with a Hall of Fame induction, a new exhibit reveal, and a night of technology-driven experiences.

BYTE25 recognized three trailblazers whose contributions shaped the digital world. **Dr. David Bader** revolutionized high-performance computing with his work on Linux-based supercomputers. Dan Bricklin, hailed as the "Father of the Spreadsheet," changed business forever with VisiCalc. And John Yates, a leader in technology law, helped build Atlanta's thriving tech ecosystem. Each inductee took the stage to reflect on their achievements and the future of innovation.

With its rebranding as the Mimms Museum of Technology and Art, the Institution signaled its expansion beyond computing history to explore the intersection of technology and creativity. Founder Lonnie Mimms shared his vision for the museum's next chapter, ensuring its role as a hub for education and inspiration.

Guests at BYTE25 received an exclusive first look at groundbreaking artifacts and the unveiling of the stunning Salvador Dali exhibit, featuring signed prints by the legendary artist. The event also showcased a cutting-edge technology exhibit with interactive displays and rare artifacts, reinforcing the museum's commitment to preserving history while embracing the future.

Television personality, actor, and author Tom Clark brought energy and humor as the evening's emcee and auctioneer. Attendees enjoyed "byte"-sized delicacies, signature cocktails, a spirited auction, live music by The Real Acoustic Soul, dancing, networking and a chance to mingle with tech industry leaders.

BYTE25 wasn't just a night of reflectionâ€”it was a launchpad for the future, proving that the story of technology is still being written, one byte at a time.
