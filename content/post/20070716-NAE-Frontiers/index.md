The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has
selected two Georgia Tech faculty — College of
Computing Associate Professor **David Bader** and
Mechanical Engineering Assistant Professor
Samuel Graham — to participate in the NAE’s
annual Frontiers of Engineering symposium, a
three-day event that will bring together engineers
ages 30 to 45, who are performing cutting-
edge engineering research and technical
work in a variety of disciplines. Participants
were nominated by fellow engineers or organizations
and chosen from 260 applicants.
The symposium will be held Sept. 24-26 at
Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash., and will
examine trustworthy computer systems, safe
water technologies, modeling and simulating
human behavior, biotechnology for fuels and
chemicals and the control of protein conformations.

Engineering, visit www.nae.edu/frontiers.
