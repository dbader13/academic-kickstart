Dear **David**,

Congratulations! You have been selected to become the next School of Engineering UBM Regents' Lecturer. This is a special award that recognizes your extraordinary accomplishments and leadership in teaching, research, and service as a junior faculty member. There are only two such awards available in the School at any given time, so this award represents a singular honor. Your selection was the result of a rigorous review of the nomination packages of a number of excellent candidates by the School of Engineering Administrative Committee (AdCom). You should be justly proud of your selection.

...

Sincerely,

Joseph L. Cecchi  
Interim Dean and Professor
