NVIDIA today recognized Georgia Institute of Technology
(Georgia Tech) as a CUDA Center of Excellence. One of the world's premier engineering and
science universities, Georgia Tech is engaged in a wide number of research, development and
educational activities which leverage GPU Computing.

Jeffrey Vetter, joint professor of the Georgia Tech College of Computing and Group Leader at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will serve as principal investigator of the CUDA Center of
Excellence.

"Georgia Tech has a long history of education and research that depends heavily on the
parallel processing capabilities that NVIDIA has introduced with its CUDA architecture,"
Vetter said. "This award allows us to focus, what is now a large amount of activity across 25
different research groups, under a single center, which will significantly amplify our research
capabilities."

Georgia Tech's non-profit research arm, Georgia Tech Research Institute, is also leveraging
the capabilities of the GPU in its work with industry and government groups such as the U.S.
Defense Department.

"By cross-pollinating ideas and skills, sharing software and hardware facilities, and
streamlining interactions with priority access to NVIDIA staff and capabilities, this status
will add considerable strength to our research and educational programs," Vetter added.

NVIDIA and Georgia Tech are already collaborating on a number of projects that will help
shape the national science infrastructure. The National Science Foundation Track 2D
Keeneland Project will initially deploy a significant system of NVIDIA Tesla processors
this year, with a larger, petaflop-class system to be in place by 2012. Georgia Tech and Oak
Ridge are also collaborating with NVIDIA in the recently announced DARPA Ubiquitous
High Performance Computing program, with the goal of designing an energy efficient
"petaflop in a cabinetÂ¿ prototype system in 2018.

One example of the work the University is doing in the field of software tools is "Ocelot", a
compiler that allows CUDA code to run seamlessly on multicore CPUs. The compiler will be
available and distributed through the CCOE and will help to catalyze research on top of this
open source infrastructure.

Georgia Tech joins a select group of 10 other universities and research organizations in the
US and abroad, including Harvard University, Cambridge University and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, that are designated as a CUDA Center of Excellence. More than 350
universities worldwide teach the CUDA programming model within their curriculum.

CUDA is NVIDIA's computing architecture that enables its GPUs to be programmed using
industry standard programming languages and APIs, opening up their massive parallel
processing power to a broad range of applications beyond graphics.

program.

### About NVIDIA ###

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) awakened the world to the power of computer graphics when it
invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999. Since then, it has consistently set new
standards in visual computing with breathtaking, interactive graphics available on devices
ranging from portable media players to notebooks to workstations. NVIDIA's expertise in
programmable GPUs has led to breakthroughs in parallel processing which make
supercomputing inexpensive and widely accessible. Fortune magazine has ranked NVIDIA
#1 in innovation in the semiconductor industry for two years in a row. For more information,
