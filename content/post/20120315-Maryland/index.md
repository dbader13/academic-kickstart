Dear **David**,

On behalf of the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, I am honored to announce that you have been selected as a recipient of the Inaugural ECE Distinguished Alumni Award. We are pleased to inform you that you were nominated by ECE faculty member, Joseph JaJa, who shared your accomplishments and impressive contributions to the field, which exemplify this award. This prestigious award will be presented annually to alumni that have provided leadership and meritorious contributions in the broad field of engineering.  We are delighted to have someone of your stature as both an alumnus of our department and a 2012 Distinguished Alumni honoree.

The conferring of this award will take place on May 11, 2012. We understand that you will not be able to join us and would like to invite you to speak in our Booz Allen Hamilton Distinguished Colloquium Series during the Fall 2012 semester. We would like to honor you at that time and present your award.

...

Again, congratulations on your selection. We are pleased to celebrate your achievements at this premiere department event, and look forward to having you join us in the fall.

Most Sincerely,

Rama Chellappa  
Professor and Interim Chair
