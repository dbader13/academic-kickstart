New Jersey Institute of Technology announced Tuesday it will establish a new institute focused on data science.

The Institute for Data Science will conduct both basic and applied interdisciplinary research and development in all areas related to digital data to solve fundamental and real-world problems, NJIT said. It will also join together existing research centers in big data, medical informatics and cybersecurity with new research centers in data analytics and artificial intelligence.

The institute will be directed by **David Bader**, a professor and leading expert in data science. Bader recently joined NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing from Georgia Tech, where he was chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Computing. He was previously the director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor.

Fadi P. Deek, provost and senior executive vice president of NJIT, said the institute is a strategic move for NJIT.

“Complementing our new facility in Jersey City, which will focus on data science training, NJIT is making significant investments in technological R&D to drive the new AI economy. The new institute is a key step in that direction. I cannot think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Bader to lead the new institute and we are fortunate to have him join us,” Deek said.

“The new institute and its distinguished director will be a giant leap forward for NJIT’s research enterprise. Beyond the increase in basic research that the new institute will generate, we will also collaborate closely in applied research with the thriving tech ecosystem in the greater New York metro area. These companies are hungry for data science expertise and solutions, and we will be in an excellent position to provide them,” Atam P. Dhawan, senior vice provost for research at NJIT, said.
