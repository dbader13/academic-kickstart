(*Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA. 8 April 2019*) After five years, Professor David Bader has decided not to seek another term as the chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and is returning to faculty and his research.

Bader, a founding faculty member of the school (then a division), became chair in summer 2014. Since then, enrollment in the school’s M.S. program has more than doubled to 190 students. The school also has 71 Ph.D. students and teaches hundreds of others in interdisciplinary degrees including the M.S. in Analytics and the M.S. and Ph.D. programs in bioinformatics and bioengineering.

Research funding has also grown during Bader’s tenure as chair. CSE faculty had 83 active research projects with $67 million worth of funding ($34 million at Georgia Tech) as of August 2018. In that year, average research expenditures per CSE faculty member were $622,000 – the highest in the college. During his tenure as chair, the school’s research expenditures per year increased significantly from $4.3 million to $7.5 million.

In 2015, Bader launched the school’s Strategic Partnership Program, which allows companies to work with CSE faculty and graduate students. The program has grown to include 11 partners, including Accenture, IBM, Northrop Grumman, NVIDIA, and Sandia National Laboratories.

“Computational Science and Engineering represents the College of Computing’s strong commitment to interdisciplinary research and education,” said Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Deam of Computing. “We are proud of the school’s successes over the past five years.”

Bader is a fellow of the IEEE, AAAS and SIAM and has advised the White House on the National Strategic Computing Initiative. He is the editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing, and a previous editor-in-chief IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. He is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science.
