Fourth-graders of the Bethlehem Area School District and Moravian Academy learn of Colonial ways by doing and viewing in the annual Junior Craftsmen Along the Monocacy program, which opened yesterday in the 18th Century Industrial Area near downtown Bethlehem, framed by window in left photo. More than 85 pupils in the 8th grade of the district's middle schools, who have researched, studied and in some cases built their crafts, demonstrated for the 700 pupils in the 4th grade.  Above, Marifel Estrada of Spring Garden Elementary School seems to enjoy her 'punishment' in a pillory, where she was placed by **David Bader** (left) and David Rader (right). Activities are to continue 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. today.
