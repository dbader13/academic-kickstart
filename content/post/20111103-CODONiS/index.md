Seattle-based [CODONiS](http://codonis.com), a provider of advanced computing platforms for life sciences and healthcare, has teamed up with scientists from the world-renowned Institute for Systems Biology, a nonprofit research organization in Seattle, to advance biomedical computing for future personalized healthcare. The results from this ground-breaking collaboration will be discussed at the “Personalized Healthcare Challenges for High Performance Computing” panel discussion being held at the SC11 Conference in Seattle on November 15, 2011.

Dr. David Galas of the [Institute for Systems Biology](http://systemsbiology.org), will lead the session highlighting current efforts and opportunities in data-intensive, next-generation medicine. One of the most complex issues in high-performance computing and personalized healthcare is the challenge of aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data generated from numerous and diverse sources.

“The impact of high performance computing on biomedical data analysis and the consequent understanding of health and disease is growing explosively,” Galas said. “The future impact on healthcare will be immense.”

This 90-minute session will offer a number of perspectives on current and future clinical applications of life sciences computing, with audience participation encouraged. In addition to Dr. Galas, other panelists will include: James Harding, president of CODONiS; Dr. Eric Stahlberg, of the National Cancer Institute; **Dr. David Bader**, of the Georgia Institute of Technology; and Dr. Seunghwa Kang, of Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.
