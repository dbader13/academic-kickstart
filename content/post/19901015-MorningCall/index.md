The worldwide triumph of the free market system foreshadows prosperous economic conditions in 20 years, a Lehigh University professor told a Lehigh commencement audience yesterday.

"I think it's going to be great," said J. Richard Aronson, professor of economics during the university's 112th annual Founder's Day ceremonies in Packer Memorial Church.

Judging by the worldwide growth and power of the market system, average annual family incomes in 2010 could reach $95,000, he said. And college graduates could earn as much as $150,000 -- "so you can pay your child's $40,000 tuition bill."

But today's world conditions could also sour, Aronson said. The break-up of the Soviet Union into nationalist revolutions and the insecurity of the Middle East could tumble the world into deep depression, he said.

America's infrastructure, including everything from deteriorating highways to a lost will to study and take risks, could decay as well and cause economic ruin, he said.

"I get depressed just thinking of these things," Aronson said.

He advised the graduates to take advantage of the future and all its inherent risks. "Use your imaginations," he said, "and you must find work that you love. If you love your work you'll prosper. Prosperity runs deeper than economic success."

After Aronson's remarks, 95 Lehigh Valley residents received undergraduate and advanced degrees. The Lehigh Valley residents are among 206 students who completed their degree requirements during the past summer.

Two honorary degrees were also awarded during the ceremony. Bernard L. Cohen The 1936 Lehigh graduate is well known for his civic leadership in the Lehigh Valley. Cohen is retired chairman of the board and chief executive operator of Piercing Pagoda, the national jewelry chain that he and his wife Berte founded.

Luther W. Brady, one of the world's foremost cancer specialists, received an honorary doctor of science degree. He is the Hylda Cohn/ American Cancer Society professor of clinical oncology and chairman of the department of radiation oncology and nuclear medicine at Hahnemann University, Philadelphia.

Two Lehigh faculty members who have been named to endowed professorships in the past year were honored during the ceremony. They are Mark H. Bickhard, the Henry L. Luce Professor of Cognitive Robotics and Philosophy of Knowledge, and D. Raymond Bainbridge, the Coopers Lybrand Professor in Accounting.

During the ceremony, 50 students were honored for outstanding achievements. Nine local students were among those honored. They include:
