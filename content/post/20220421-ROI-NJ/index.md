Innovating: If your company isn’t doing it, it probably will not be around for very long. We all get that. The question is: Who is doing it best?

That’s what we set out to tackle in our second annual ROI Influencers: Technology list.

Our goal was to select those who are having the most impact in the technology and innovation sectors.

Categorizing the list wasn’t easy.

It starts with the founders — those who have created the cool and innovative companies that dot the state. But it wouldn’t be complete without the investors that helped many of them grow, the academics who are mentoring and inspiring the next generation, the executives of tech companies that give the state such a rich ecosystem and the thought leaders that help bring everyone together.

This year, we’ve added the key service providers who are helping these companies grow — and the chief technology and chief innovation officers, the ones that are the heads of so much internal innovation.

We’re overwhelmed with the quality of honorees on the list — and humbled to know that there are many others out there deserving of the recognition. We’re confident this list will only grow each year.
