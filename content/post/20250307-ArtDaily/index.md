ROSWELL, GA.- During its BYTE fundraiser last evening, Computer Museum of America revealed an exciting announcement – moving forward, it will operate under a new name: Mimms Museum of Technology and Art. The rebrand marks an exciting new chapter for one of the area’s most popular attractions, reflecting its history, evolution and future. As the nonprofit museum celebrates five years of operation and prepares for expansion in 2026 – including the highly anticipated launch of its iNSPIRE: Fifty Years of Innovation at Apple exhibit – the timing of its transformation is setting the stage for a bold and dynamic future.

“Our museum has always been about more than just computers,” said Lonnie Mimms, founder and board chair of Mimms Museum of Technology and Art. “We are thrilled to introduce a new brand that provides us the flexibility to promote the full scope of what we offer, aligning us with STEAM initiatives that are shaping both education and technology – two industries deeply embedded in our mission.”

Since opening in 2019, the museum has expanded its scope and vision, as well as its on-site offerings, programming and experiences. While technology remains its foundation, the museum’s mission has evolved beyond a singular focus. The Mimms team recognized that technology and art are deeply interconnected, with examples of Innovation Past Forward—the museum’s tagline—reflected in both disciplines.

Initially, the museum featured three main exhibits, A Tribute to Apollo 11, Supercomputing, and The STEAM Timeline. Since then, it has expanded to include an interactive Retro Gaming Corner and unveiled The Enigma Machine exhibit in 2020. iNSPIRE: Fifty Years of Innovation at Apple will open in Spring 2026, spanning an impressive 20,000 square feet, and featuring the world’s largest curation of Apple products, merchandise, early prototypes and uncommon collector’s items. In addition to its permanent exhibits, the museum now features rotating pop-up exhibits, currently showcasing a Strati 3D car.

Embracing the synergy between art and technology, Mimms Museum of Technology and Art took the opportunity – while introducing its new brand during the BYTE25 event – to unveil its exclusive new Salvador Dalí Exhibit. Event attendees were given a first look at the remarkable collection featuring more than 20 signed Salvador Dalí prints, which opened to the public today. The evening also featured a special Hall of Fame induction ceremony, honoring three trailblazing pioneers in the technology industry: **Dr. David Bader**, Dan Bricklin, and John Yates. As the second class of distinguished inductees, their contributions have left a lasting impact on the field.

“We remain committed to our core mission of preserving and celebrating the past while embracing the limitless possibilities of the future,” said Rena Youngblood, executive director of Mimms Museum of Technology and Art. “With our new name and several new initiatives planned, we are poised to grow, inspire, and engage the community in meaningful ways, just as technology and art continue to shape our lives.”
