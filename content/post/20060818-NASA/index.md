College of Computing Ph.D. student Kamesh Madduri has received a NASA Graduate Student Researchers Program (GSRP) Fellowship for his proposal titled, “Performance Analysis and Optimization of NASA Scientific Applications on the NAS Supercomputers.”  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration began the competitive program in 1980 to support 100 promising students each year who are pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering, and to cultivate research ties to the academic community.

Madduri was selected based on an extremely competitive evaluation of his academic qualifications, his proposed research plan, and his planned use of NASA research facilities. GSRP fellowships, for up to $22,000, are awarded for one year and are renewable based on satisfactory progress for a total of three years. Madduri is doing his research under the supervision of Associate Professor **David Bader**.
