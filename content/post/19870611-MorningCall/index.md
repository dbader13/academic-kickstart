"The Miles of Life" was the theme as 389 Liberty High School seniors became graduates last night in Lehigh University's Stabler Arena.

Samuel Rodriguez Jr., the commencement speaker chosen by members of the graduating class, told the audience, "Graduation from Liberty represents the conclusion of the first mile and the commencement of the second."

He explained how in the 13 years of their school careers his fellow graduates "have acquired academic fundamentals" as well as other "essentials of success in life."

But in addition, he said, "We have acquired discipline and the ability to grow further toward wisdom. We have acquired a special pride and an intimate sense of unity.

"Above all is our recognition that in this life we do not want to merely survive, but we want to succeed.

"We must not be satisfied with just reaching the reachable and conquering the conquerable. We must use all of the essentials which we now have within our grasp to reach the unreachable, to conquer the unconquerable."

David Minor, the commencement speaker chosen by the faculty, pointed out, "Throughout our years of education, our purpose has not been to learn the right answers, but instead to see how diverse subjects as literature, mathematics, history and science are all related. We have been presented with the searches which people who have preceded us have made.

"Now our turn comes, our chance to take the opportunity and initiative and search for ourselves.

"Look around you and notice the events which touch your lives and why they affect you. Do not let the last 13 years be a waste. Continue your learning throughout your lives."

Liberty's commencement was moved from the school's campus to the arena this year to provide more space and to eliminate concerns about heat in the gymnasium and rain when attempts were made to hold it in the stadium that have made ceremonies uncomfortable in the past.

Students were recognized for academic achievement by Principal Anthony Ruggiero and for school and community service by Assistant Principal Edwin E. Abel Jr. and acting Assistant Principal Roberta J. Whitcomb. Jean Trend, guidance counselor, recognized those students receiving scholarships.
