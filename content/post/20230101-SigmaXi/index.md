## Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturers 2023--2024 ##

For the 85th year, Sigma Xi presents its panel of Distinguished
Lecturers as an opportunity for chapters to host visits from
outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science. These
visitors communicate their insights and excitement on a broad range of
topics.

The Distinguished Lecturers are available from July 1, 2023, to June
30, 2024. Each speaker has consented to a modest honorarium together
with full payment of travel costs and subsistence.

Local chapters may apply for subsidies to support expenses related to
hosting a Distinguished Lecturer. Applications must be submitted
online by March 1, 2023, for funds to be available the next fiscal
year.

Additional support for the program comes from the American
Meteorological Society. Lecturer biographies, contact information, and
additional details can be found online at sigmaxi.org/lectureships or
by sending an email to lectureships@sigmaxi.org.
