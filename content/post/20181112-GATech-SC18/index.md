Georgia Tech high-performance computing (HPC) experts are gathered in Dallas this week to take part in the HPC community’s largest annual event — the [International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/) — commonly referred to as Supercomputing. This year’s conference, SC’18, opened Sunday at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas and runs through Nov. 16. 

“Georgia Tech researchers are presenting 23 separate events this week, including four technical paper presentations, several workshops, panels, and even a doctoral showcase with CSE [School of Computational Science and Engineering] Ph.D. student Patrick Flick,” said Center for High Performance Computing Director and CSE Professor Rich Vuduc.  

One of the papers being presented, *HiCOO: Hierarchical Storage of Sparse Tensors*, by CSE recent graduate Jiajia Li and CSE Associate Professors Vuduc and Jimeng Sun was nominated as one of the five best student papers of 288 submissions in this year’s program.

Attendees can also stop by the Georgia Tech booth (#1217) to talk with faculty and students, take a moment to watch the live feed of fish from the [Georgia Aquarium](https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/), and view additional Georgia Tech HPC research with the research slide deck. Swag items are also available, including [Superheroes of Supercomputing Cards](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/superheroes-supercomputing) and Georgia Tech-branded bags.  

The complete Georgia Tech SC’18 proceedings, projects, and research slides can be viewed [here](https://spark.adobe.com/page/nUNKgdyX5xsox/).
