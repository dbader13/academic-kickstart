**Abstract:**

Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these social problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for research on scalable algorithms and architectures, and development of frameworks for solving these real-world problems on high performance computers, and for improved models that capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, **David Bader**, New Jersey Institute of Technology, will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data science for applications in social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.

**David A. Bader** is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Prior to this, he served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, AAAS, and SIAM, and advises the White House, most recently on the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI). Dr. Bader is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. His interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing and real-world applications, including cybersecurity, massive-scale analytics, and computational genomics, and he has co-authored over 250 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Dr. Bader has served as a lead scientist in several DARPA programs including High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) with IBM, Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) with NVIDIA, Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS), Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT), Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE), and Software-Defined Hardware (SDH). He has also served as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor. Bader is a cofounder of the Graph500 List for benchmarking “Big Data” computing platforms. Bader is recognized as a “RockStar” of High Performance Computing by InsideHPC and as HPCwire’s People to Watch in 2012 and 2014. In April 2019, Bader was awarded an NVIDIA AI Lab (NVAIL) award, and in July 2019, Bader received a Facebook Research AI Hardware/Software Co-Design award. http://www.cs.njit.edu/~bader

Virtual ICM Seminars in Computer and Computational Science are a continuation of the Supercomputing Frontiers Europe conference, which took place virtually in March 2020 and will be back with the new HPC trends to explore in the summer 2021.

Worldwide Open Science online meetings in HPC, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, BigData, IoT, computer and data networks are a place to meet and discuss with such personalities as Hiroaki Kitano (Systems Biology Institute, Tokyo / Sony Computer Science Laboratories), Stephen Wolfram (Founder & CEO, Wolfram Research), Alan Edelman (MIT), Aneta Afelt (ICM University od Warsaw, Espace-DEV, IRD Montpellier France), Simon Mutch (University of Melbourne) or Scott Aaronson (University of Texas at Austin).

For the listing of all ICM seminars please check this link with recordings – https://supercomputingfrontiers.eu/2020/past-seminars/

Since March 2020, over 2250 people have participated in virtual meetings organized by ICM (SCFE + 13 seminars) from almost all the time zones. The https://supercomputingfrontiers.eu/ website with access to the SCFE and seminars’ recordings, has been visited by more than 13k visitors from 122 countries.

## About the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling (ICM), University of Warsaw (UW) ##

Established by a resolution of the Senate of the University of Warsaw dated 29 June 1993, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling (ICM), University of Warsaw, is one of the top HPC centres in Poland. ICM is engaged in serving the needs of a large community of computational researchers in Poland through provision of HPC and grid resources, storage, networking and expertise. It has always been an active research centre with high quality research contributions in computer and computational science, numerical weather prediction, visualisation, materials engineering, digital repositories, social network analysis and other areas.
