The Liberty High School team placed first in the 14th Professor John Steiner Gold Mathematical Competition held recently at Bucknell University.

Team and individual winners were determined through a written examination given at Bucknell in Lewisburg. **David Bader**, William Brewster and Neil Szanyi comprised the Liberty team from the Bethlehem Area School District. Second place went to Lewisburg Area High School and third to Williamsport Area High.

Among the individual winners were Brewster, first place, and Szanyi, third. **Bader** earned an honorable mention.  Brewster also received a book and certificate of recognition given to the highest ranking individual in each school.
