Professor **David Bader** (CompSci & Eng) received the IEEE Computer Society’s Golden Core Member award during the IEEE Computer Society’s Executive Board Meeting in Long Beach, Calif., Feb. 2. 

The [Golden Core Member award](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/awards/goldencore) was established in 1996 and recognizes individuals for long-standing service to the society. Each year the awards committee selects recipients from a pool of qualified candidates and permanently includes their names in the Golden Core Member master list.

[Bader](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/), who serves as executive director of high performance computing in the School of Computational Science & Engineering, received the award for his extensive service to the IEEE Computer Society.
