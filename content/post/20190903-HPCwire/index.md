**David Bader**, director of the new Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), has received an award from Facebook to support analytics research. Bader joined NJIT from Georgia Tech, where he was chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering. His research aims to develop faster learning patterns to make it easier to extract actionable information from large datasets.

“Every sector from finance to health, transportation, retail to security, and fashion and entertainment, is rich in data,” Bader said. “These are often large, noisy data sets, with missing elements. We want to create tools for better understanding of these data sets.”
