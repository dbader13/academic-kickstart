## TALK INFORMATION ##

SPEAKER:  H. Edward Seidel, NCSA director

TITLE:  Computing and Data Challenges for Multi-Messenger Astronomy

ABSTRACT:  Multi-messenger astronomy, that is, the ability to view and understand the universe though multiple "messengers" (e.g., gravitational waves, electromagnetic (including optical, infrared and radio), neutrinos, and cosmic rays), along with models and simulations will bring a revolution in our understanding of the universe and its constituents.  Each one of these fields is itself undergoing a revolution. In isolation, each may lead to Nobel Prize caliber discoveries in the coming decade; combining them for comprehensive understanding of great mysteries is where the true Grand Challenges of the Universe lie --- to answer fundamental questions such as what is a gamma-ray burst, or what is dark energy. I will describe basic concepts of multi-messenger approaches to astronomical observation and simulation, and describe the tremendous computing challenges these approaches bring.

 

BIO:  NCSA director H. Edward Seidel is a distinguished researcher in high-performance computing and relativity and astrophysics with an outstanding track record as a researcher and administrator. In addition to leading NCSA, he is also a Founder Professor in the University of Illinois Department of Physics and a professor in the Department of Astronomy.

His previous leadership roles include serving as the senior vice president of research and innovation at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Moscow, directing the Office of Cyberinfrastructure and serving as assistant director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the U.S. National Science Foundation, and leading the Center for Computation & Technology at Louisiana State University.

Seidel is a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. His research has been recognized by a number of awards, including the 2006 IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award.

He earned a master’s degree in physics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 and a doctorate in relativistic astrophysics at Yale University in 1988.
