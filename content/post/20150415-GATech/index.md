**David Bader**, professor and chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering
at Georgia Tech, delivered the keynote address during the recent "International
Opportunities in Cloud Computing & Big Data" conference. Bader, executive director of High
Performance Computing, explains why graph analysis is crucial for big data.

*Social networks use big data to spot influencers and target advertising to
the right user. Biologists need data to understand common drug
interactions and design better medication. Utility providers use it to
monitor disruptions and improve resiliency. Graphs are the unifying motif
for data analysis, and as real-world
circumstances constantly change,
dynamic graphs are essential.*

*Businesses with global challenges need graph analysis of big data.*

*At Georgia Tech, many globally significant challenges – across a variety
of industries – are being modeled by spatio-temporal
interaction networks
or graphs, which we call “STING” at the School of Computational Science
and Engineering. STING graphs are accessible through “STINGER”
(http://www.stingergraph.com) – a freely available, open source software
project. STINGER – developed by Georgia Tech with colleagues in
academia, government and industry – reveals dynamic temporal and
semantic relationships between datasets in a way that makes unseen
activity, or hidden threats, observable.*

*These streaming graphs solve problems that typically are hard to address
because of the massive amounts of data involved and the need for
supercomputers. The graphs are optimized to update large amounts of
constantly fluctuating data at rates of more than 3 million edges per
second on graphs of 1 billion edges.*

*It can help businesses observe the number of users on a social networking
platform at a given time or the number of kilowatts in demand by a
neighborhood. For example, for social good, the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention was able to observe public tweets on Twitter to
track flu outbreaks during the 2009-10
H1N1 health emergency.
Consulting firms, aeronautical engineers and energy researchers all have
found STINGER useful for their business.*

*The volume of data available to us is growing at an overwhelming rate.
Graph analytics can discover the value within massive datasets. It finds
the proverbial needle in a haystack.*
