In 2010, **David A. Bader** received the [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/) [Golden Core Award](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/golden-core). A plaque is awarded for long-standing member or staff service to the society. This program was initiated in 1996 with a charter membership of 450. Each year the Awards Committee will select additional recipients from a continuing pool of qualified candidates and permanently include their names in the Golden Core Member master list.
