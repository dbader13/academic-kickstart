Almost three years after the launch of [OpenAI’s GPT3.5](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/everything-you-need-to-know-about-openai/slideshow/97276114.cms) in November 2022, the techno optimists would say that the world of artificial intelligence is closer to superintelligence than ever before.

From the beginning of this year, the world has seen one breakthrough launch of GenAI foundation models after another, starting with [DeepSeek-R1 in January](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/ettech-explainer-what-is-deepseek-chinas-competitor-to-openai/articleshow/117577579.cms?from=mdr) to [OpenAI](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/openai)’s [GPT-5 early](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/openais-chat-gpt-5-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/123184361.cms?from=mdr) this month.

OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman said in his June blog that we are closer to building “digital superintelligence”. But others are not as convinced.

**David Bader**, director of the institute of data science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, recently said that “superintelligence, properly defined, would represent systems that exceed human performance across virtually all cognitive domains. We’re nowhere near that threshold.”

## Milestones ##

## International Math Olympiad, July 2025 ##

An experimental mode of OpenAI and [Google](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/google) DeepMind’s Gemini DeepThink reached a significant milestone when they achieved [gold in the International Mathematical Olympiad](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-and-openais-ai-models-win-milestone-gold-at-global-math-competition/articleshow/122825546.cms?from=mdr) by scoring 35 points out of 42 in July.

Multiple people in the industry pointed out that this was an impressive feat for AI models. Gary Marcus, an American psychologist, in his post said, “Awfully impressive” and added that “a gold medal in the IMO is an accomplishment that even very successful mathematicians and scientists may well highlight on their CVs all their lives.”

To be sure, it is unclear how this will help with mathematical research in the future..

## Coding ##

So far this has been the year of coding agents.

From OpenAI to Gemini and everyone in between are focusing on upping their coding performance. While [Claude](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/claude) is one of the favoured [models for coding](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-releases-claude-opus-4-1-amid-rival-chatgpts-advancements/articleshow/123143392.cms?from=mdr), other platforms are catching up. In May, Google launched coding agent Jules.

In July, Google paid $2.4 billion in licensing fees to coding platform Windsurf and hired founder Varun Mohan and other key personnel in the firm. OpenAI rolled out Codex in May and said that its latest model GPT-5 shows strong performance for coding. This puts these platforms in direct competition with startups such as Cursor and Lovable.

## 2025: CITIUS, FORTIUS, ALTIUS ##

## DeepSeek, January ##

When the Chinese open source model DeepSeek-R1 was launched in January 2025, to say they took the world by storm would be an understatement.

Dubbed “DeepSeek moment”, it marked a significant technological breakthrough in training large language models. Unlike its Western counterparts, DeepSeek used reinforcement learning, a machine language technique, to train the system to make decisions through trial and error, with optimal results being rewarded.

This helped the Chinese LLM maker to reduce the cost dramatically and at the same time performance was on par with the likes of OpenAI for reasoning.

## Gemini 2.5, March ##

Search giant Google Search giant Google [launched the Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-rolls-out-experimental-version-of-gemini-2-5-pro-for-free-users/articleshow/119789671.cms?from=mdr) Experimental model, its most advanced model yet, in March.

These are reasoning models, as Google calls it thinking models, which shows strong reasoning and coding capabilities, and ranks high when it comes to coding, mathematics and science.

On August 1, the company provided access to [Gemini 2.5 Deep Think](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/award-winning-variant-of-geminis-ai-model-is-live-confirms-ceo-sundar-pichai/articleshow/123046462.cms?from=mdr) for Ultra subscribers. According to its blog, Deep Think “is capable of thinking longer and generating multiple parallel streams of thought simultaneously” similar to how a human brain processes complex tasks.

## Claude 3.7 and 4 Sonnet, February and May ##

Anthropic [launched Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-launches-advanced-ai-hybrid-reasoning-model/articleshow/118544367.cms?from=mdr), its most intelligent model and its first hybrid reasoning model, in February. The company said that they did a few things different for its reasoning model compared to its competition.

According to the company, the latest model was designed to work for both instant responses and deep thinking, “Just as humans use a single brain for both quick responses and deep reflection.” Users will also have some control over how long they want the model to “deep think”.

In addition, Anthropic said that they had optimised the model less for math and computer science competition problems and focused more on tasks the real businesses used LLMs for.

In May, [Anthropic launched Claude 4 Sonnet](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-rolls-out-claude-4-family-of-ai-agents/articleshow/121347800.cms?from=mdr), which it said is a significant upgrade to 3.7 in terms of extended reasoning, and newer capabilities such as following instructions more accurately and running tools in parallel.

## Grok 3 and 4, February and July ##

After launching the reasoning model [Grok 3 in February](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/grok-3-ai-launch-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/118328908.cms?from=mdr), Elon Musk’s AI company xAI [launched Grok 4](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/elon-musk-unveils-grok-4-a-day-after-post-on-hitler-and-antisemitic-responses-sparked-outrage/articleshow/122358675.cms?from=mdr) in July. The company trained the latest model on 200,000 GPU clusters to run reinforcement learning, it said in a post.

“This was made possible with innovations throughout the stack, including new infrastructure and algorithmic work that increased the compute efficiency of our training by 6x.” It launched Grok Heavy, which allows the model to consider multiple hypotheses through parallel test-time computing. .

## OpenAI O3 and GPT-5, April and August ##

OpenAI [launched reasoning models, o3 and o4](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/openai-introduces-o3-o4-mini-reasoning-models/articleshow/120371270.cms?from=mdr)-mini, its reasoning models that were “trained to think longer before responding” in April. For the first time, these models can use every tool in GPT such as search and image generation.

Following this, after much speculation, OpenAI launched the [much-anticipated GPT-5](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/openai-makes-gpt-5-friendly-again-after-users-complain-of-cold-responses/articleshow/123356472.cms?from=mdr) early this month. The firm said GPT-5 is a unified system, which is efficient, capable of deeper reasoning, and has a router which chooses models based on the nature of conversation.

Designed for handling real-world tasks, it hallucinates, follows instructions better and shows strong performance across coding, writing and health.


## Key misses ##

While 2025 was a breakthrough year in terms of the advanced models from tech firms, a few have seen significant setback. Notably, [Meta](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/meta)’s open source model [Llama](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/llama).

## Llama ##

After Meta saw significant success with Llama, the latest launch had hit snags. According to a report from the [Wall Street Journal](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/wall-street-journal) in May, Meta is delaying the launch of Llama 4 as the company struggles to improve the capabilities of Llama 4 model Behemoth.

The model was expected to be released in April and now the launch has reportedly been pushed to fall or later. A July report from the New York Times revealed that Meta might abandon Llama and go for development of closed-source models under the Superintelligence team headed by Alexandr Wang.
