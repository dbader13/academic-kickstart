Kamesh Madduri won the best poster award in the Ph. D. Forum at the 22nd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) held April 14-18 in Miami. Madduri’s research in computational science and high-performance computing beat out 72 other submissions to win one of two prizes in the competition.

The main track of IPDPS is highly competitive and contains peer-reviewed papers submitted from researchers worldwide. Only 105 of the submitted 410 papers were accepted for presentation. As a testament to Georgia Tech’s strength in parallel and multicore computing, four papers from Computational Science and Engineering division were presented as regular papers:

* *SNAP, Small-world Network Analysis and Partitioning: An Open-Source Parallel Graph Framework for the Exploration of Large-Scale Networks*    
**David Bader** (CSE); Kamesh Madduri (CSE)

* *High Performance MPEG-2 Software Decoder on the Cell Broadband Engine*   
**David Bader** (CSE); Sulabh Patel (Electronic Arts, USA)

* *Financial Modeling on the Cell Broadband Engine*   
Virat Agarwal (CSE); Lurng-Kuo Liu (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, USA); **David Bader** (CSE)

* *Performance Characterizations and Optimization of Parallel I/O on the Cray XT*   
Weikun Yu (ORNL), Jeffrey Vetter (ORNL & CSE) and Sarp Oral (ORNL)

IPDPS attracts over 600 of the top scientific researchers in the field for a week packed with technical talks and demonstrations.  In 2009, the meeting will be held in Rome, Italy, and in 2010, **David Bader** (CSE) will serve as the General Chair when the symposium comes to Atlanta.
