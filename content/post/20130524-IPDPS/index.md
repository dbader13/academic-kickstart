Georgia Tech's leadership in education and research came through clearly at the 27th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS2013) in Cambridge, MA the week of May 19-24, 2013. IPDPS accepted only 22% of submissions, and Georgia Tech's Schools of Computational Science and Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering participated in nine of the total 108 papers and one of the 23 PhD posters. Four of the associated and well-known workshops contained Georgia Tech research. One graduating student presented his thesis research at the IPDPS PhD forum. In addition, **David A. Bader** was recognized as the recipient of this year’s IEEE Computer Society’s Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) Outstanding Service Award.
