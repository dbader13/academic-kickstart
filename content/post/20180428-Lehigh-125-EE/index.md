In April 2018, the ECE department at Lehigh University celebrated a huge milestone- the 125th Anniversary of the department!  Alumni, students, guest and faculty members all showed their support in our one day celebration.  Many thanks to our key note speakers who took time out of their day to talk to our department about the “Future Directions of ECE”, “Electrical Engineering: Future in Industry & Areas”, and “How can we Improve ECE at Lehigh”.  Our Keynote Speakers included: **David Bader** (Professor & Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology), Michael Reffle (Infinera Corporation) and Philip Wong (Professor at Standford University).  Our Panel Speakers included: Aref Chowdhury (CTO of Optics at Nokia), Jeff Karper (Manager, Power Systems Engineering at Lockheed Martin-Rotary & Mission Systems), Sean Anderson (Principal Engineering with MACOM Technology Solutions), Thomas Charisoulis and Eileen Mazzochette.
