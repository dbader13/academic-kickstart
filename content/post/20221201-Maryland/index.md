Within the clark school’s
Innovation Hall of Fame (IHOF),
**David Bader (Ph.D. ’96)**—
the hall’s 2022 inductee—
joins a distinguished community of inventors who use
their knowledge, perseverance,
innovation, and ingenuity to
change the world.
Bader “democratized” supercomputing by designing the first Linux Supercomputer RoadRunner for open use by the national science and engineering
community from a prototype he built in 1998 using commodity off-the-shelf parts. His computer was first used in April
1999; the top 500 supercomputers operating in the world
today have roots in Bader’s early work.
In a Q&A, Engineering at Maryland asks Bader about
his path to IHOF:

**You learned to program before you could read or write.
How did this shape the direction of your future work?**

My father was a physical chemist and an early computational scientist and my mother is an inorganic chemist,
so they both get a lot of credit for my appreciation of the
sciences and engineering.
In the 1970s, “programming” really meant the thoughtful use of resources, because every
computer was limited in terms of
memory size, cost of operations,
etc. It set me in a direction of
thinking about algorithms and how
we can accelerate algorithms to run
even faster.

**Your work on supercomputers
and high-performance computing
began in the 90s. What drove you?**

At the time, I had a couple areas
of focus that I was very passionate
about; one was thinking about our
nation’s security and how we spread
peace to everyone on the planet.
For me, understanding large
data sets was important. Exploring
data sets from remote sensing of the
Earth, biological sequences, and social networks led the way to
what we see today with big data and the massive scale of data
science, high performance data analytics, and the area that I’ve
pioneered in massive graph analytics.
As we have access to more and more data sets, we can
now think about the power of combining these together to
solve today’s global grand challenges. To me, that’s just a
tremendous opportunity to improve the world and to make
it a better place for everyone.

**Why was “democratizing” supercomputers important to you?**

I grew up in a first-generation American family. My
mother was a child Holocaust survivor from Europe, and
my dad’s parents immigrated to the United States. In the
late 1970s when I was in 5th grade, I started delivering newspapers to earn enough money to buy my own computer. In
the early 1980s I discovered parallel computing, but to get
into supercomputing you needed millions of dollars to buy
a unique commercial system.
I had a passion to harness multiple processors together to
solve important and computationally demanding problems,
and I recognized early that this would require harnessing the
economics of commodity-based systems to make supercomputing ubiquitous.
To me, democratizing supercomputers means making
them accessible to anyone in the world who wishes to work
on these kinds of big problems. Solutions to real-world grand
challenges can come from anyone, not just from people who
can afford million-dollar supercomputers.

**What do you hope for the future?**

I would like to see the continued leveraging of commodity
technologies and miniaturization of technologies so that we
could deploy supercomputers ubiquitously. These systems
must integrate new architectures that combine scientific computing capabilities with new technologies for supporting data
science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
There are so many phenomenal uses that if everyone
had access to a supercomputer—maybe we will see them in
our next generation of smartphones—then we would see a
tremendous amount of change.
That’s really my dream: to make supercomputing access
as simple as driving a car or reading a book or carrying your
smartphone, so that everyone with a question can solve
real-world grand challenge problems quite easily
