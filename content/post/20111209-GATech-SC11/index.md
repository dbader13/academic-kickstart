Georgia Tech leveraged its strengths in high performance computing Nov 12-18 at the
SC11 conference in Seattle, with a strong showing in the technical program and through
faculty members building on current research partnerships and collaborations.

More than 10,000 attendees in industry, academic research and government came to
experience the latest developments in Big Data and high performance computing at SC11,
the international conference for HPC, networking, storage and analysis.

Georgia Tech faculty and graduate students led or took part in at least 20 activities within
the technical program at the SuperComputing conference, one of the largest industry
tradeshows Georgia Tech attends. More than 40 faculty, students and staff attended the
event.

“Georgia Tech excels at solving Big Data problems that are emerging in health informatics,
business analytics, social media, and national security,” said **David A. Bader**, professor of
computing and executive director of high performance computing. “Solving real-world
problems is the hallmark of our School of Computational Science and Engineering, and our
accomplishments in this area received recognition at SC11.”

In the technical program, the Graph500 announcement, in which Bader unveiled the
ranking of the world's fastest supercomputers, was standing-room-only; and the GT-hosted
Intel machine, mirasol, came in at No. 19 on the list. Aparna Chandramowlishwaran’s
George Michael HPC Fellow presentation engaged a large audience with a high level of
interaction afterwards.

Georgia Tech’s booth included a continuous presentation on four monitors of more than 60
current research initiatives in which faculty members are involved. The research highlighted
the comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach at Georgia Tech in tackling a broad
range of application areas in massive data and high performance computing.
