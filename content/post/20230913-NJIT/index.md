A research group led by **Distinguished Professor David Bader** has won the 2023 Student Innovation Award from the IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing (HPEC) conference for their paper “[Triangle Counting Through Cover-Edges](https://davidbader.net/publication/2023-blgglrd/2023-blgglrd.pdf).”

The group features NJIT faculty and students, as well as a high school student. It is composed of Bader, Principal Senior Researcher Zhihui Du, doctoral candidates Fuhuan Li and Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez, Jason Lew ’23, former NJIT research intern Anya Ganeshan of Columbia University and Ahmet Gundogdu of Paramus High School. 

Bader also won the Innovation Award for his paper on “Fast Triangle Counting.”

The winning papers will be featured as part of the IEEE HPEC conference, which is organized by MIT and sponsored by the IEEE Boston Section, and is the largest computing conference in New England with more than 125 talks. The conference will be presented virtually Sept. 19-23.

Ying Wu College of Computing at NJIT will be further represented through accepted papers on “Parallel Longest Common SubSequence Analysis in Chapel” (co-authors: Professor Baruch Schieber, David Bader, Zhihui Du, and Ph.D. candidate Soroush Vahidi) and “Property Graphs in Arachne” (co-authors: David Bader, Zhihui Du and Ph.D. candidates Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez and Fernando Vera Buschmann).

HPEC hosts leading-edge innovations on: AI, machine learning, big data, graph analytics, cloud computing, sensor processing, cyber, parallel computing, GPU computing, database technology and quantum computing, among others, along with tutorials and many distinguished invited speakers. See below for registration link and preliminary schedule link.
