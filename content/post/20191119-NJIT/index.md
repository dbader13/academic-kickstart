NJIT@JerseyCity is located at 101 Hudson
Street on the Jersey City waterfront and,
in addition to an ultra-modern learning
environment, also provides an expansive
view of the iconic Manhattan skyline.

NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing
(YWCC) offers a master’s degree in Data
Science as well as graduate certificates in Big
Data and Data Mining at NJIT @JerseyCity.
YWCC plans to add a graduate certificate
in Data Visualization in spring 2020 and
further expand next fall to include Cyber
Security graduate programs. Non-credit data
science accelerator programs will begin later
this year.

Jersey City was chosen for NJIT’s new
location because of the strong demand
for data scientists in the area. Most of the
graduate students at NJIT @JerseyCity
are working professionals attending the
programs in the evenings, hailing from
companies and organizations such as
Microsoft, IBM, Bank of America, JPMorgan
Chase, Prudential, BNY Mellon, TD
Ameritrade, NJ Transit, Con Edison and
City National Bank.

Roberto Rivera, a business major working
as a market research professional for New
Jersey Transit, said he’s excited about the
new program at NJIT@JerseyCity. “I do a
lot of market analysis on the NJ Transit data
using traditional tools. I will be pursuing the
Certificate in Data Mining to enhance my
skillset and match the recent initiative of NJ
Transit, investing in technology that makes
our business smarter, faster and better. I
am fortunate to have the strong support of
my managers in this endeavor. They value
a combination of quality education with
practical skills.”

“My employer collects an enormous
quantity of data from its customers on a
daily basis, and we are constantly looking
for ways to put it to good use and improve
our service,” added Evo Yaset, an electrical
engineer and student at NJIT@Jersey City.
Earning an M.S. in Data Science is a unique
opportunity for me to obtain the skills I
need to do precisely that. On top of that, the
location is very convenient, since I live in
Jersey City.”

## GENERATING TECH TALENT ##

For a number of years, data scientist has
ranked as one of the top jobs in the U.S. in
terms of salary and market. “The demand
is especially significant in the fast-growing
New York/New Jersey metropolitan area,
and this has been reflected in the incredible
interest we have witnessed in our Jersey City
programs. It is our duty and our privilege
to generate the tech talent to meet this
demand,” said YWCC Dean Craig Gotsman.

In practice, not all technical professionals
working with data perform the same job and
there is a need for a variety of different skills.
NJIT@JerseyCity offers multiple programs to
meet the variety of skills needed.

The certificate in Data Mining is
designed for data analysts, professionals
who work with large data sets with a focus
on data access, reporting, basic analysis
and visualization.

The certificate in Big Data Essentials is for
the data engineers, professionals responsible
for managing the infrastructure for big data
storage, rapid access and pipeline processing
of large data sets and preparing the data
for analysis.

The most comprehensive program is the
M.S. in Data Science. That program is for
those who want to pursue careers as data
scientists, who create and apply machine
learning models and predictive methods
to large data sets to extract actionable and
valuable information.

One bonus for those pursuing one of
the certificate programs is that they can
“upgrade” their education down the road
and apply certificate courses taken toward an
M.S. in Data Science.

## CUTTING-EDGE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ##

**Distinguished Professor David Bader** leads
the faculty at the Jersey City location. He
also is the director of NJIT’s new Institute
for Data Science. The Institute focuses on
cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and
development in all areas pertinent to
digital data.

**Bader** teaches the Intro to Big Data course
at NJIT@JerseyCity and is joined by Pantelis
Monogioudis, who teaches Data Mining. In
addition to his work at NJIT, Monogioudis
is also head of Applied Machine Learning
Research at Nokia Bell Labs.

Andrew Pole, of NJIT’s department of
Mathematical Sciences, teaches Applied
Statistics and Keith Williams of YWCC’s
Department of Informatics, teaches Web
Systems Development. Williams is a seasoned
software development professional, with many
years of instructional and entrepreneurial
hands-on experience in the field.

Students at NJIT@JerseyCity will develop
a deep knowledge of modern computer
science and be active participants in projects
involving artificial intelligence, big data,
analytics, data mining, visualization and
machine learning.

Beyond the academic degree programs,
NJIT @JerseyCity will offer non-credit Data
Science Accelerator programs later this
fall. In contrast to the typical boot camps
offered by others, these intense, deep-tech
five-week programs are designed for working
professionals who want to hone their data
science skills in a fast-changing marketplace.

The expansion to Jersey City enables
NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing to
continue growing its reputation as the largest
producer of computing talent in the New
Jersey/New York metro region, enrolling
more than 3,000 students and graduating
more than 800 computing professionals each
year. NJIT has been recognized as a Top 100
National University, by U.S News & World
Report, is rated by Forbes as #1 nationally
for student upward economic mobility
and ranks in the Top 2% Nationwide in
Payscale.com’s College Salary Report.

Tim Sullivan, CEO of New Jersey’s
Economic Development Authority (NJEDA),
said “Reclaiming New Jersey’s position as
the State of Innovation through targeted
investments in students and workers is
a pillar of Governor Murphy’s plan for a
stronger and fairer New Jersey economy.
NJIT’s expansion to Jersey City will create
new opportunities for New Jerseyans and
make our already highly educated workforce
even more attractive to employers and
entrepreneurs.”
