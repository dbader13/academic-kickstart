He has published numerous articles in numerical scientific computation for chemical analysis, solution of hard differential equations, and improved accuracy and error analysis in numerical computing. His chemistry publications include various chemical experiments for use by educators, and guideline and error estimates for the neglect of buoyancy in laboratory weighings. He has published in the Journal of Chemical Education and in American Laboratory of which he was a contributing editor.
