Today the Georgia Institute of Technology Office of the Provost
announced the formation of the Georgia Tech Institute for Data and High Performance
Computing (IDH) in recognition of the need to advance and coordinate institute research
and education activities in this area. High performance computing (HPC) continues to grow
as a strategically important area for Georgia Tech, both in its application to key areas of
science and engineering as well as in the advancement of the technology itself.

"As we look to high performance computing to drive advanced breakthroughs in science,
health, energy and other industries, leveraging Georgia Tech's strongest assets -- world-class
researchers in computing, experts across nearly every problem domain, and low barriers to
collaboration -- is what will set us apart," said Dr. Mark Allen, senior vice provost for
Research and Innovation at Georgia Tech. "The creation of the Institute for Data and High
Performance Computing provides the organizational foundation to harness our strategic
capabilities and attack the most challenging problems that face society today."

A key mission of IDH will be to enhance Georgia Tech's scientific contributions, reputation
and impact, focusing on the exploitation of HPC technology coupled with the development of
novel computational methods. The institute will promote the development of software and
tools to enhance multidisciplinary research and enable discovery and innovation. In
addition, it will work closely with the Office of Information Technology to ensure effective,
faculty-driven governance concerning the acquisition and use of HPC resources on campus.

The institute's interim director will be Dr. Richard Fujimoto, Regents' Professor and head of
Computational Science & Engineering in the College of Computing. One important objective
for Dr. Fujimoto will be to focus on developing new innovations in computational methods
into useable tools and software to advance research in the application domain. Creating
computational artifacts that provide value to application researchers and can be exported
beyond the Tech campus provides a critical avenue to maximize the impact of Georgia Tech
research innovations.

"Georgia Tech has made substantial infrastructure and personnel investments in high
performance computing, and achieved many important successes, over the last five years,"
said Dr. Fujimoto. "I fully anticipate that IDH will enable us to advance beyond prototypes to
new levels of accomplishment in the high performance computing area."

Key participants in the preliminary groundwork leading to the creation of the institute
include Dr. **David Bader**, Professor in the College of Computing, and Dr. Ron Hutchins, Chief
Technology Officer for Georgia Tech. Their expertise and community-building activities
helped bring together the various Georgia Tech constituencies with interests in the HPC
area, and they will remain active players in IDH as it develops and grows.

The Georgia Tech Institute for Data and High Performance Computing will begin operation
immediately.
