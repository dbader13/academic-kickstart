IBM is providing a supercomputer that uses the Linux operating system, allowing researchers and developers access to computational power they previously could not afford.

The National Computational Science Alliance, comprised of 50 academic, government and research partners, will use IBM computers as a part of its effort to create a new, highly sophisticated computer network for research.

The system, called Los Lobos, is a "supercluster" of servers, and consists of 256 IBM Netfinity PC servers, which are linked together using special clustering software and high-speed networking hardware, acting as one to process at a speed of 375 gigaflops, or 375 billion operations per second. That speed would place Los Lobos at number 24 on the world's current list of the top 500 fastest supercomputers.
