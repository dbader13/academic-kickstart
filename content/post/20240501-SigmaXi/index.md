Since 1937, Sigma Xi has presented its Distinguished Lecturers. This program is an opportunity for chapters to host visits from outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science.  Lecturers communicate their insights and excitement to a broad range of scholars and to the community at large. Each year, thousands of Sigma Xi members, students, and the public have an opportunity to hear exceptional talks and to ask questions of experts.

The Lectureship Program is supported by Sigma Xi members with additional support from partnering organizations such as the American Meteorological Society, the National Academy of Engineering, and the National Cancer Insitute.
