From cutting-edge research projects, to the most talked
about trends in networking, programming, performance analysis, and computer
and network security, the SC99 Tutorials Program offers something for
everyone with an interest in high performance computing and networking.

  SC99, the annual high performance computing and networking conference,
takes place Nov. 13-19 at the Oregon Convention Center. The conference's 12
full-day and eight half-day tutorials will be offered Sunday, Nov. 14, and
Monday, Nov. 15.

  New tutorial topics this year include a full-day session on computer and
network security issues, sessions on Linux and NT superclusters and an
overview of file systems. The session on security issues, called
"Introduction to Cryptography, Security and Privacy Technologies," will
provide an overview on the often-discussed issues of computer security and
privacy. Topics covered will include the building blocks of computer
security and privacy, cryptographic technologies, and protocols used to
construct secure and private services and systems. Charlie Catlett, senior
associate director for science and technology at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) will conduct this tutorial.

  The hot topic of clustering off-the-shelf workstations into machines with
supercomputing performance will be discussed in two tutorials. On Sunday
William Saphir and Patrick Boseman of Lawrence Berkley National
Laboratory/National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, Remy Evard
of Argonne National Laboratory, and Pete Beckman of Los Alamos National
Laboratory, will guide participants through the issues involved in setting
up and running a Linux cluster. They will present an overview of cluster
architectures, system software, and application-level software, with the
goal of pointing out software and architectures that work. On Monday
afternoon Rob Pennington, of NCSA, and **David Bader** and Barney Maccabe, of
the University of New Mexico, will talk about the NT and Linux superclusters
constructed by the National Computational Science Alliance. The NT
supercluster, located at NCSA, runs on Windows NT and uses commercial
desktop computers from Hewlett-Packard. The New Mexico supercluster, called
Roadrunner, runs on Linux and was integrated by Alta Technology. The
tutorial will provide details on the construction, configuration and
management of these systems as well as details on porting applications to
the superclusters.

  Another full-day tutorial, called "From Physics to File Systems," will be
presented by Rodney Van Meter and Paul Massiglia of Quantum Corp. on Sunday.
This tutorial will start with an overview of storage and I/O systems,
including buses, networks, disks, and tapes, and will conclude with the
latest information on hierarchical storage management systems and
distributed file systems. The tutorial will be organized around three
themes: data movement, data storage and distributed file systems.

  Several popular tutorials will be back this year with updated information.
An introduction to high-performance data mining will be presented by Robert
Grossman, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Vipin Kumar, of the
University of Minnesota. Several tutorials on performance analysis will be
offered, as will sessions on visualization of large datasets and the Globus
Grid Programming Toolkit. Globus is a software infrastructure for scientific
problem solving over computational grids. The Globus Grid Programming
Toolkit is designed to help application developers and tool builders
overcome the obstacles of remote computing and distributed supercomputing to
construct "Grid Enabled" scientific and engineering applications. The
tutorial will be presented by Steven Fitzgerald and Carl Kesselman of the
University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, and Ian
Foster, Gregor von Laszewski and Steve Tuecke of Argonne.

  "The SC tutorials are always one of the prime events of the conference,"
said Paul Shahady, chair of the SC99 Tutorials Committee. "This year, the
tutorials will offer an incredible range of topics and a huge amount of
information that participants can take back with them and use in their own
work."

  Separate registration is required for tutorials. A one or two-day Tutorial
Passport gives attendees the flexibility to attend several tutorials. More
