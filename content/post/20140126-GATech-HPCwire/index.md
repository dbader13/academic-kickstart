The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of only two major universities to house its computing program within a college of its own, today announced that **David A. Bader**, professor and executive director of High Performance Computing, has been selected as one of HPCWire’s “People to Watch” in 2014.

The 2014 list is a compilation of the 16 best and brightest minds from academia, science, and technology whose contributions in high performance computing (HPC) have the potential to profoundly impact the world this year and beyond. Finalists are selected following an extensive review process by the HPCwire editorial and executive staff along with guidance from industry analysts and luminaries across the HPC community.

Although HPCwire has recognized Bader as a “person to watch” before, he continues to garner attention and recognition for his work in big data at the intersection where high performance computing meets real-world applications.

Among his many achievements, Bader led an effort that resulted in a nearly $2 million dollar grant for researchers at Georgia Tech and the University of Southern California to bring supercomputing capabilities into the grasp of tablets, smart phones, and other devices.

Read more about Bader and his thoughts on the trends in HPC for 2014.
