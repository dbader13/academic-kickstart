The Kansas State University chapter of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society, presents a distinguished lecture by **David Bader** on Tuesday, Oct. 8. In his distinguished lectureship, Bader will share his views on "Solving Global Grand Challenges with High Performance Data Analytics" in the Wildcat Chamber at the K-State Student Union. All are encouraged to attend. You do not need to be a member.

Bader is a distinguished professor and director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is also a distinguished professor and founder of the department of data science in the Ying Wu College of Computing; and a selected Distinguished Sigma Xi Lecturer. He served as founding professor and chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology. Bader is an elected board member of the Computing Research Association. He is a fellow of the IEEE, ACM, UAAAS and SIAM; a recipient of the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award; and the 2022 Innovation Hall of Fame inductee of the University of Maryland's A. James Clark School of Engineering. The Computer History Museum recognizes Bader for developing the first Linux-based supercomputer, which became the predominant architecture for all major supercomputers in the world.

As part of his visit, Bader will participate in the following three opportunities on Oct. 8 for faculty, students and staff to discuss innovations in data science and opportunities for interdisciplinary science collaborations: 

* 9:30-10:45 a.m., 121 Eisenhower Hall: Open discussion on linking data science and other disciplines to initiate collaborations. All faculty and students are welcome. Contact mmather@k-state.edu for more information.
