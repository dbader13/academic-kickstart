## Class of '90 ##

We also heard from **David Bader**, who not only remains involved with Lehigh as a member of the advisory board of Lehigh's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, but also serves as the inaugural director of New Jersey Institute of Technology's Institute for Data Science. This past year, he received one of computing's highest honors, the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award for inventing commodity-based supercomputing that can be traced back to his Lehigh days. David graduated with both bachelor's and master's degrees from Lehigh and now lives in Manhattan.
