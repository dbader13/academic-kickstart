School of Computational Science and Engineering Chair and Professor **David Bader** was named Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of [ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (ACM ToPC)](https://topc.acm.org/index.cfm) this morning. 

ACM Transactions on Parallel Computingis a forum for novel and innovative work on all aspects of parallel computing, and addresses all classes of parallel-processing platforms, from concurrent and multithreaded to clusters and supercomputers. 

“I am excited for this opportunity to operate as the Editor-in-Chief of such a prestigious publication for a three-year term. I am a founding board member of TOPC, and follow the founding EiC, [**Phil Gibbons**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gibbons/), in this role,” said Bader.

Bader’s term of appointment will formally begin November 1.

Bader is also a Fellow of the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/membership/fellows/index.html) and [AAAS](https://www.aaas.org/fellows/listing?field_last_name_value=&name_combine=&field_institutional_affiliation_value=&field_address_city=&field_address_administrative_area=All&field_address_country_code=All&field_year_elected=&field_primary_aaas_sectio) and advises the White House, most recently on the [National Strategic Computing Initiative](https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/).  He is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. He has co-authored over 230 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences and has presented significant contributions to the field of parallel computing; aligning his history and passions well to this new role.

“The nominating committee selected Professor Bader as the second EiC of ACM ToPC among several exceptionally well-qualified candidates,” said Nominating Committee Chair and Professor at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies **Uzi Vishkin**. 

“We are expecting him to solidify the standing of ACM ToPC as the flagship ACM journal on parallel computing and for taking the journal to new heights.”
