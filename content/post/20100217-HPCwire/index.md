The 25th International Supercomputing Conference -- ISC'10 -- the
leading HPC event in 2010, introduces four new special sessions to address some of the
biggest challenges in science, industry and technology today. The sessions on HPC
Computational Life Sciences, New Markets, Networking and Energy form the first part of the
ISC'10 conference special sessions.

The four-day conference and trade fair will once again be held at the Congress Center
Hamburg, Germany, from May 30 – June 3, 2010, bringing together some 2,000 IT
managers, researchers and enthusiasts to exchange knowledge and ideas, foster contacts and
do business. The complete program comprises educational tutorial sessions, a conference
and an exhibition consisting of 140 industrial and research exhibits. All conference
proceedings are conducted in English.

The four new special sessions are:

**High Performance Computational Life Sciences** – The Challenge for HPC Systems:
As computational life sciences become a strategic discipline at the frontier between
molecular biology and computer science, impacting medicine, biotechnology, as well as
society, this special session on Monday, May 31, provides a forum on latest research. The
session is chaired by Prof. Dr. **David A. Bader**, Executive Director of High-Performance
Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, and Prof. Dr. Matthias Rarey, Managing
Director of the Center of Bioinformatics, University of Hamburg, Germany.

Leading European and U.S. scientists will cover a broad spectrum of topics, from
macromolecular structures to bioinformatics infrastructure to pharmaceutical and medical
applications.

**Evolving New HPC Markets: China, Middle East & Russia**: Participants in this
Tuesday, June 1, session will learn more about the new evolving HPC markets that show
tremendous growth potential. Chaired by Dr. Happy Sithole, Director, Center for High
Performance Computing, South Africa; global and regional experts will look at various new
trends, for example, the entrance of China into the petascale arena, the installation of a very
large HPC system in the Middle-East/Saudi Arabia and the remarkable growth in the
number of installations in Russia and the upcoming installations in Africa.

**High Performance Computing & Networking:** This session will discuss the potential
of network innovations and virtualization technology in support of high-performance
computing applications. The session will also examine recent proposals for low-latency
communication, such as low-latency Ethernet. Taking place on Wednesday, June 2, this
session is chaired by Prof. Dr. Georg Carle, Professor for Network Architectures & Services,
Technische Universität München, Germany.

Perspectives will be provided by cloud computing experts from the research and industrial
fields.

**Supercomputers for Modeling the Climate & the Roles of Energy Production in
Climate Change:** In this Thursday, June 3, session chaired by Prof. Dr. David Blaskovich,
Program Director for HPC in Government & Research, IBM, USA, three scientists will
discuss the use of HPC to simulate the role of energy production, i.e., carbon dioxide
emissions, in climate change, and the implications of tapping alternative energy sources. A
fourth presentation by the chairman will concentrate on the adaptation of alternative energy
production at a large data center as an example of the institutional use of non-polluting
energy to power large data centers. An overview of the ISC'10 conference program can be
found at http://www.supercomp.de/isc10/Program/Overview.

Advance registration is now open for ISC'10 and in addition to reduced rates, a number of
one-day options for both the conference and exhibition are offered by the organizers. For

### About ISC'10 ###

Now in its 25th year, ISC is the world's oldest and Europe's most important conference for
the HPC community, offering a strong four-day technical program with a wide range of
expert speakers and exhibits from leading research centers and vendors. A number of events
complement the technical program, including Tutorials, Scientific Day, Birds of a Feather
(BoF) sessions, a research poster session, Exhibitor Forum and the popular "Hot Seat
Sessions" featuring leaders from industry and research centers. The conference has
experienced tremendous growth over the last few years, with an estimated 2,000
participants from around the world expected to convene in Hamburg in 2010.

ISC'10 is open to IT-decision makers, members of the HPC global community and other
interested parties. The ISC exhibition allows analysts, decision-makers from the automotive,
defense, aeronautical, gas & oil, banking and other industries; solution providers, data
storage suppliers, distributors, hardware and software manufacturers, the media, scientists
and universities to see and learn firsthand about new products, applications and
technological advances in the supercomputing industry today. For registration, conference
