In his letter of recommendation for **David Bader** to the Omicron Delta Kappa National Honor Society, University of Maryland Electrical Engineering Department Chair Nariman Farvardin states:

> **Mr. David Bader** is the founder and currently the president of the Graduate Student Association in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  He has been working relentlessly over the past six months to create a sense of identity for this organization and to establish a closer tie between the graduate students and the faculty and staff.  He has formed a cluster of students who care about advancing the graduate student life and has led the way in a number of new initiatives such as: (i) the graduate student coffee hour, (ii) the graduate student electronic newsgroup, (iii) the graudate student fellowship book, (iv) the graduate student job bank and (v) the graduate student handbook.
