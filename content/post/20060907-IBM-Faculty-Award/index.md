Congratulations to Associate Professor **David Bader** who recently received a 2006 [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) Faculty Award in recognition of his outstanding achievement and importance to industry.  The highly competitive award, valued at $40,000, was given to Bader for making fundamental contributions to the design and optimization of parallel scientific libraries for multicore processors, such as the IBM Cell. As an international leader in innovation for the most advanced computing systems, IBM recognizes the strength of collaborative research with the College of Computing at Georgia Techâ€™s Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) division. 
 
Bader is part of the College's growing CSE division, established in 2005 to strengthen and better reflect the critical role that computation plays in the science and engineering disciplines at Georgia Tech and in the broader technology community. Along with theory and experimentation, computation has gained widespread acceptance as a key component in the advancement of knowledge and practice. As a division of the College of Computing, CSE supports multidisciplinary research and education in computer science that solves grand challenges in science and engineering. CSE is designed to innovate and create new expertise, technologies, and practitioners.

IBM does not accept unsolicited requests or proposals for Faculty Awards. Candidates must be nominated by an IBM employee with common interests who will serve as a liaison for the collaboration. Awardees may be nominated for an award renewal, and renewal nominations engage in the same competition as first-time nominations.
