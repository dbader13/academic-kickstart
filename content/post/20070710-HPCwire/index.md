Georgia Tech is one of the first universities to deploy the IBM BladeCenter QS20 Server for production use,
through Sony-Toshiba-IBM (STI) Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine (http://sti.cc.gatech.edu/) in the College of
Computing at Georgia Tech. The QS20 uses the same ground-breaking Cell/B.E. processor appearing in products such as Sony
Computer Entertainment's PlayStation3 computer entertainment system, and Toshiba's Cell Reference Set, a development tool for
Cell/B.E. applications.

The Georgia Tech installation includes a cluster of 28 Cell/B.E. processors (14 blades) and supports the operation of Cell-optimized
multi-core applications in areas such as digital content creation, gaming and entertainment, security, scientific and technical
computing, biomedicine, and finance. Georgia Tech grants users access on the cluster to test drive the Cell/B.E. processor and
support independent software vendors (ISVs) that develop products and tools for the Cell/B.E. processor. The Georgia Tech
Cell/B.E. processor installation uses Altair Engineering's PBS Professional job scheduling software that increases the utilization of
the IBM Blade Center QS20.

"The Cell/B.E. processor represents the future of computing using heterogeneous multi-core processors, and we are proud to help
drive the continued advancement of computationally-intensive applications that will directly impact the global growth of our industry
and evolution of our society," said **David A. Bader**, Associate Professor and Executive Director of High-Performance Computing in
the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.

Accounts on the Georgia Tech CellBuzz Cluster can be requested by visiting the Georgia Tech -- STI Cell/B.E. web page at
http://sti.cc.gatech.edu/ and clicking on the "CellBuzz Cluster" link.
