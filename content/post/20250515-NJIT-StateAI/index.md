Distinguished Professors **David Bader** and Guiling “Grace” Wang,
along with Professors Cristian Borcea and Vincent Oria in the Ying Wu
College of Computing (YWCC), served on Governor Phil Murphy’s AI Task
Force. Comprised of industry leaders, academic experts, consumer
advocates and government innovators, the group worked to establish
programs, trainings and tools that will advance New Jersey’s
leadership in AI.

Recommendations by the task force were published in “The Report to the
Governor on Artificial Intelligence,” which aims to create economic
opportunities for residents and businesses, encourage ethical use of
AI technologies, promote equitable outcomes, support public and
private workforces and improve government services and citizen
experience.

The YWCC faculty members each contributed to primary working groups in
four areas: security, safety and privacy considerations for AI use
cases; workforce training, jobs of the future and training public
professionals; AI, equity and literacy; and making New Jersey a hub
for AI innovation.

Recommendations included ways to expand opportunities for AI education
and literacy, promote a strong workforce and AI talent pipeline,
address biases and discrimination, foster a collaborative AI
innovation ecosystem and economy across the state, and bolster the
state’s use of GenAI to support policy outcomes and improve the
resident experience.

In addition to his work with the state, Bader serves on other boards,
including on the Computing Research Association. In addition, he is a
scientific advisory board member for the Flatiron Institute, Simons
Foundation; an advisory board member for ARLIS at the University of
Maryland and steering committee chair for the Seed Fund at the
Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub.

Wang, the director of NJIT’s Center for Artificial Research, serves as
a technology expert for a state committee aimed at helping judges and
lawyers understand AI’s role in the legal system. The New Jersey State
Court Artificial Intelligence Committee is examining potential
policies and practices in numerous areas, and Wang is the sole
academic appointed to the committee of 31 members. Wang also has been
named to serve as an AI subject matter expert for the Department of
Homeland Security’s Science Advice and Guidance for Emergencies
Program, where she may be called upon by the DHS Chief Scientist to
provide counsel during national emergencies.
