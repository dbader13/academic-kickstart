The 32nd HPC Connection Workshop will be held during SC23 in Denver, Co. on Nov 15, 2023. World renown experts and scholars will exchange on the latest artificial intelligence, supercomputing technologies, and applications. Topics include progress on the newest developments in AI and supercomputing applications, and recent optimization strategies for large-scale parallel computing.

Featured speakers include:

* Mauricio Araya Polo will present a set of algorithms ported to the Cerebras CS2. The implementations following this paradigm deliver disruptive level performance.
Anshumali Shrivastava will demonstrate the algorithmic progress that can exponentially reduce the compute and memory cost of pre-training, training, fine-tuning, as well as inference with LLMs.
* Yuval Bachar will share the blueprint for the next generation of sustainable computing infrastructure, ready to usher in a greener era of AI-driven advancements now.
* **David Bader** will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data-intensive computing for applications in computational science and engineering.
