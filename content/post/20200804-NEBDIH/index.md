## Seed Fund Announcement ##
 
The Northeast Big Data Hub is delighted to announce our Seed Fund program this month. The Seed Fund is designed to promote collaboration and support the cross-pollination of tools, data, and ideas across disciplines and sectors including academia, industry, government, and communities. Funding provided through this program is intended to support the northeast region and align with the Major Goals and Focus Areas of the Northeast Big Data Hub.

Two programs are open for applications as part of the 2020 Seed Fund program:
