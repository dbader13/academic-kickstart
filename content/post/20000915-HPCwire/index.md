Albuquerque, N.M. — IBM announced the opening of the industry’s first Linux supercluster briefing center for customers developing scalable applications on Linux systems. The briefing center will be based at the **University of New Mexico’s (UNM) Albuquerque High Performance Computing Center (AHPCC)**, and complements the existing briefing facility at the Maui High Performance Computing Center (Maui HPCC).

The new briefing center will assist customers in planning their Linux and Linux clusters plans with IBM, and allow them to benchmark and “test-drive” key applications. The UNM supercluster, called Los Lobos, consists of 256 IBM Netfinity servers (512 Intel IA-32 processors running at 733 MHz) that collectively provide peak performance of about 375 gigaflops. IBM will engage petroleum and manufacturing companies, the scientific and technical community, financial institutions, and higher education and government institutions who are deploying high performance computing solutions with Linux. Customers can draw on IBM and UNM’s experience, skill and resources to help meet their technical needs.

“The University of New Mexico is excited to extend our ongoing relationship with IBM,” said Dr. Frank Gilfeather, executive director of the High Performance Computing, Educational and Research Center at the University of New Mexico. “This new briefing center will bring high performance computing beyond the research community.”

UNM is a Doctoral/Research Universities-Extensive, one of about 145 universities. Among UNM’s outstanding research units are the Cancer Center, New Mexico Engineering Research Institute, Center for High Technology Materials, Center for Micro-Engineered Ceramics and the Center for Non-Invasive Diagnosis.

IBM is the world’s largest information technology company, with 80 years of leadership in helping businesses innovate. IBM creates, develops and manufactures some of the industry’s most advanced information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking systems, storage devices and microelectronics.
