Dear **Dr. Bader**:

Upon the recommendation of the organizing committee, I am please to invite you to participate in the National Academy of Engineering's 2007 U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. The symposium will be held at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA beginning Monday, September 24 and ending around noon on Wednesday, September 26.

...

Advances in engineering are moving with incredible spped across many facets of the profession. The goal of the Frontiers of Engineering symposium is to bring together outstanding leaders of these engineering developments. The convening of top-notch people from disparate fields and challening them to think about the developments at the frontiers of areas different from their own could lead to a variety of desirable results, including collaborative work, the transfer of new techniques and approaches across fields, and the establishment of contacts among the next generation of engineering leaders.

The total number of participants at the symposium will be 100 engineering, generally 30-45 years old. This number includes the organizing committee and speakers. Participants will be from industry, universities, and government labs, and will represent a range of engineering fields, including aerospace, chemical, electrical, environemntal, civil, materials, and mechanical engineering. Sponsoring agency representatives and a few senior engineers will also be invited to attend.

...

Sincerely,

Wm. A. Wulf  
President
