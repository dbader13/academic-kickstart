On behalf of ORI and Sigma Xi, we welcome you to this workshop on
"Ethical Challenges and Practical Solutions for Managers in Research."

Science and engienering undergird the economic success of this country
and will be drivers in the next century.  However, to maintain the
quality of the necessary research and the confidence of the public and
others who fund research, it will be essential for managers to instill
standards of high integrity. This workshop will examine some of the
challenges to accomplishing this task.

You active participation is an essential element for making this
workshop a success. We invite you to question the speakers and
participate fully in the breakout session to offer your own insights
into the problems and potential solutions.

Sincerely,

Chris B. Pascal, J.D.   
Acting Director   
Office of Research Integrity
