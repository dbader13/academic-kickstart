Maryland Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) alumnus **David Bader** will join the Computational Science and Engineering faculty at Georgia Tech this fall.

Dr. Bader completed his Ph.D. at the University of Maryland in 1996. As a graduate student, he was advised by Professor Joseph JaJa (ECE/UMIACS). Bader founded and served as president of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Graduate Student Association while he attended school at Maryland. Prior to his recent hiring at Georgia Tech, Dr. Bader served as an Associate Professor of ECE and Computer Science at the University of New Mexico. He received a National Science Foundation (NSF) Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award for his research on High-Performance Algorithms for Scientific Applications last fall.
