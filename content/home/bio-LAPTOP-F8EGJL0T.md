David A. Bader is a Distinguished Professor and founder of the
Department of Data Science and inaugural Director of the Institute for
Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.  Prior to this, he
served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational
Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of
Technology.

Dr. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and SIAM, and a recipient of
the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award. He advises the White
House, most recently on the National Strategic Computing Initiative
(NSCI) and Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem (FACE). Bader is a
leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science,
engineering, computing, and data science. His interests are at the
intersection of high-performance computing and real-world
applications, including cybersecurity, massive-scale analytics, and
computational genomics, and he has co-authored over 300 scholarly
papers and has best paper awards from ISC, IEEE HPEC, and IEEE/ACM SC.
Dr. Bader has served as a lead scientist in several DARPA programs
including High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) with IBM,
Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) with NVIDIA, Anomaly
Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS), Power Efficiency Revolution For
Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT), Hierarchical Identify
Verify Exploit (HIVE), and Software-Defined Hardware (SDH). Recently,
Bader received an NVIDIA AI Lab (NVAIL) award, and a Facebook Research
AI Hardware/Software Co-Design award.

Dr. Bader is Editor-in-Chief of the *ACM Transactions on Parallel
Computing*, and General Co-Chair of *IPDPS 2021*, and previously
served as Editor-in-Chief of the *IEEE Transactions on Parallel and
Distributed Systems*. He serves on the leadership team of Northeast
Big Data Innovation Hub as the inaugural chair of the Seed Fund
Steering Committee.  ROI-NJ recognized Bader as a technology
influencer on its 2021 inaugural and 2022 lists. In 2012, Bader was
the inaugural recipient of University of Maryland's Electrical and
Computer Engineering Distinguished Alumni Award.  In 2014, Bader
received the Outstanding Senior Faculty Research Award from Georgia
Tech.  Bader is a member of

(National Engineering Honor Society),
[Eta Kappa Nu]({{<relref "/post/19890410-hkn">}})
(Electrical Engineering Honor Society), and
[Omicron Delta Kappa]({{<relref "/post/19950404-odk">}})
(National Leadership Honor Society).
Bader has also served as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of
Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor and Director of an
NVIDIA GPU Center of Excellence. [In 1998, Bader built the first Linux
supercomputer that led to a high-performance computing (HPC)
revolution,]({{<relref "/post/20210426-linuxsupercomputer">}}) and
Hyperion Research estimates that [the total economic value of Linux
supercomputing pioneered by Bader has been over $100 trillion over the
past 25 years.]({{<relref "/publication/2022-HyperionResearch">}})
Bader is a cofounder of the Graph500 List for benchmarking "Big Data"
computing platforms. He is recognized as a "RockStar" of High
Performance Computing by InsideHPC and as HPCwire's People to Watch in
2012 and 2014.
