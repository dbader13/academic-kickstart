David A. Bader is a Distinguished Professor and founder of the
Department of Data Science and inaugural Director of the Institute for
Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.  Prior to this, he
served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational
Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of
Technology.

Dr. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and SIAM; a recipient of
the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award; and the 2022 Innovation Hall of Fame
inductee of the University of Maryland's A. James Clark School of
Engineering. He advises the White House, most recently on the National
Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and Future Advanced Computing
Ecosystem (FACE). Bader is a leading expert in solving global grand
challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. His
interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing and
real-world applications, including cybersecurity, massive-scale
analytics, and computational genomics, and he has co-authored over 300
scholarly papers and has best paper awards from ISC, IEEE HPEC, and
IEEE/ACM SC.  Dr. Bader has served as a lead scientist in several
DARPA programs including High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS)
with IBM, Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) with NVIDIA,
Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS), Power Efficiency
Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT), Hierarchical
Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE), and Software-Defined Hardware
(SDH). Recently, Bader received an NVIDIA AI Lab (NVAIL) award, and a
Facebook Research AI Hardware/Software Co-Design award.

Dr. Bader is Editor-in-Chief of the *ACM Transactions on Parallel
Computing*, and General Co-Chair of *IPDPS 2021*, and previously
served as Editor-in-Chief of the *IEEE Transactions on Parallel and

(National Leadership Honor Society).
Bader has also served as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of
Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor and Director of an
NVIDIA GPU Center of Excellence. [In 1998, Bader built the first Linux
supercomputer that led to a high-performance computing (HPC)
revolution,]({{<relref "/post/20210426-linuxsupercomputer">}}) and
Hyperion Research estimates that [the total economic value of Linux
supercomputing pioneered by Bader has been over $100 trillion over the
past 25 years.]({{<relref "/publication/2022-HyperionResearch">}})
Bader is a cofounder of the Graph500 List for benchmarking "Big Data"
computing platforms. He is recognized as a "RockStar" of High
Performance Computing by InsideHPC and as HPCwire's People to Watch in
2012 and 2014.
