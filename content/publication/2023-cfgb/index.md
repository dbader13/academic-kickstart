abstract: "Triangles and squares count are widely-used graph analytic
metrics providing insights into the connectivity of a graph. While the literature
has focused on algorithms for global counts in simple graphs, this
paper presents parallel algorithms for global and per-node triangle and
square counts in large multigraphs. The algorithms have linear improvements
in computational complexity as the number of cores increases.
The triangle count algorithm has the same complexity as the best-known
algorithm in the literature. The squares count algorithm has a lower execution
time than previous methods. The proposed algorithms are evaluated
on six real-world graphs and multigraphs, including protein-protein
interaction graphs, knowledge graphs and large web graphs."
