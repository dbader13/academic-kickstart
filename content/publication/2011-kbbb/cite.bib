 abstract = {Graphs are a general approach for representing information that spans the widest possible range of computing applications. They are particularly important to computational biology, web search, and knowledge discovery. As the sizes of graphs increase, the need to apply advanced mathematical and computational techniques to solve these problems is growing dramatically. Examining the mathematical and computational foundations of the analysis of large graphs generally leads to more questions than answers. This book concludes with a discussion of some of these questions.},
