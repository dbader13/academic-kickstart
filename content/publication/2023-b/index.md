abstract: "Listing and counting triangles in graphs is a key algorithmic kernel for network analyses including community detection, clustering coefficients, k-trusses, and triangle centrality. We design and implement a new serial algorithm for triangle counting that performs competitively with the fastest previous approaches on both real and synthetic graphs, such as those from the Graph500 Benchmark and the MIT/Amazon/IEEE Graph Challenge. The experimental results use the recently-launched Intel Xeon Platinum 8480+ and CPU Max 9480 processors."
