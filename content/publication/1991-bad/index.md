abstract: "This thesis describes the design procedures for the constructing an object oriented simulation. The object oriented programming technique enables simulations of real world events to be modeled with ease. The gateway between the internal simulation and external user interface is described, and the appearance of the user interface for simulati0ns is discussed. A prototype system for designing 2D steel structural frames given initial structural engineering constraints has been built and will be reviewed. Also, an example simulation of a parallel processing network will be given."
