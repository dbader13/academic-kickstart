 abstract = {Identifying  key  members  in  large  social  network graphs is an important graph analytic. Recently, a new centrality measure  called  triangle  centrality  finds  members  based  on  the triangle support of vertices in graph. In this paper, we describe our  rapid  implementation  of  triangle  centrality  using  Graph-BLAS,  an  API  specification  for  describing  graph  algorithms in  the  language  of  linear  algebra.  We  use  triangle  centralityâ€™s algebraic algorithm and easily implement it using the SuiteSparse GraphBLAS library. A set of experiments on large, sparse graph datasets  is  conducted  to  verify  the  implementation.}
