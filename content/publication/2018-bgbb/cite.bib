 abstract = {Sparse data computations are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Unlike their dense data counterparts, sparse data computations have less locality and more irregularity in their execution, making them significantly more challenging to parallelize and optimize. Many of the existing formats for sparse data representations on parallel architectures are restricted to static data problems, while those for dynamic data suffer from inefficiency both in terms of performance and memory footprint. This work presents Hornet, a novel data representation that targets dynamic data problems. Hornet is scalable with the input size, and does not require any data re-allocation or re-initialization during the data evolution. We show a Hornet implementation for GPU architectures and compare it to the most widely used static and dynamic data structures.},
