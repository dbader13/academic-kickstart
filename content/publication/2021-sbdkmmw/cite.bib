 abstract = {Graph algorithms can be expressed in terms of
linear algebra. GraphBLAS is a library of low-level building
blocks for such algorithms that targets algorithm \emph{developers}.
LAGraph builds on top of the GraphBLAS to target users of
graph algorithms with high-level algorithms common in network
analysis. In this paper, we describe the first release of the
LAGraph library, the design decisions behind the library, and
performance using the GAP benchmark suite. LAGraph, however,
is much more than a library. It is also a project to document and
analyze the full range of algorithms enabled by the GraphBLAS.
To that end, we have developed a compact and intuitive notation
for describing these algorithms. In this paper, we present that
notation with examples from the GAP benchmark suite.}
