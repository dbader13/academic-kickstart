abstract: "The emerging discipline of algorithm engineering has primarily focused on transforming pencil-and-paper sequential algorithms into robust, efficient, well tested, and easily used implementations. As parallel computing becomes ubiquitous, we need to extend algorithm engineering techniques to parallel computation. Such an extension adds significant complications. After a short review of algorithm engineering achievements for sequential computing, we review the various complications caused by parallel computing, present some examples of successful efforts, and give a personal view of possible future research."
