 abstract = {Due to the emergence of massive real-world graphs,
whose sizes may extend to terabytes, new tools must be developed
to enable data scientists to handle such graphs efficiently. These
graphs may include social networks, computer networks, and
genomes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph package,
Arachne, to make large-scale graph analytics more effortless
and efficient based on the open-source Arkouda framework.
Arkouda has been developed to allow users to perform massively
parallel computations on distributed data with an interface
similar to NumPy. In this package, we developed a fundamental
sparse graph data structure and then built several useful graph
algorithms around our data structure to form a basic algorithmic
library. Benchmarks and tools were also developed to evaluate
and demonstrate the use of our graph algorithms. The graph
algorithms we have implemented thus far include breadth-first
search (BFS), connected components (CC), k-Truss (KT), Jaccard
coefficients (JC), triangle counting (TC), and triangle centrality
(TCE). Their corresponding experimental results based on realworld
and synthetic graphs are presented. Arachne is organized
as an Arkouda extension package and is publicly available on
GitHub (https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit).}
