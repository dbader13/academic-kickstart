abstract: "At first thought, one may not realize the need for a special issue of Parallel and Distributed Computing Practices focused on Cluster Computing when our community has already invested years of research and spent a wealth of resources on traditional Big Iron supercomputers, for instance, the SGI/Cray Origin and IBM SP. Academia, industry, and national laboratories are still using, and for the foreseeable future, will continue to use, supercomputers to solve both grand-challenge scale and high-throughput applications. Then why the interest and new popularity of research into clusters for high-performance parallel and distributed applications? Clusters incorporate the tremendous successes that are attributable to our parallel and distributed processing community."
