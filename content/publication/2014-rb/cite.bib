 abstract = {High-performance graph analysis is unlocking knowledge in problems like anomaly detection in computer security, community structure in social networks, and many other data integration areas. While graphs provide a convenient abstraction, real-world problems' sparsity and lack of locality challenge current systems. This talk will cover current trends ranging from massive scales to low-power, low-latency systems and summarize opportunities and directions for graphs and computing systems.},
