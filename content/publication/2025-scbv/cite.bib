 abstract = {For fast processing of increasingly large graphs, triangle counting - a common building block of graph processing algorithms, is often performed on GPUs. However, applying massive parallelism to triangle counting is challenging due to the algorithmâ€™s inherent irregular access patterns and workload imbalance. In this work, we propose WeTriC, a novel wedge-parallel triangle counting algorithm for GPUs, which, using fine(r)-grained parallelism through a lightweight static mapping of wedges to threads, improves load balancing and efficiency. Our theoretical analysis compares different parallelization granularities, while optimizations enhance caching, reduce work-per-intersection, and minimize overhead. Performance experiments indicate that WeTriC yields 5.63x and 4.69x speedup over optimized vertex-parallel and edge-parallel binary search triangle counting algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, we show that WeTriC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (i.e., on avg. 2.86x faster than Trust and 2.32x faster than GroupTC). (Best Paper Award Finalist)}
