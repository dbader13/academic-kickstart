 abstract = {Counting and finding triangles in graphs is often used in real-world analytics to characterize cohesiveness and identify communities in graphs. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of a cover-edge set that can be used to find triangles more efficiently. We use a breadth-first search (BFS) to quickly generate a compact cover-edge set. Novel sequential and parallel triangle counting algorithms are presented that employ cover-edge sets. The sequential algorithm avoids unnecessary triangle-checking operations, and the parallel algorithm is communication-efficient. The parallel algorithm can asymptotically reduce communication on massive graphs such as from real social networks and synthetic graphs from the Graph500 Benchmark. In our estimate from massive-scale Graph500 graphs, our new parallel algorithm can reduce the communication by 44.5x on a scale 36 and by 441x on a scale 42.}
