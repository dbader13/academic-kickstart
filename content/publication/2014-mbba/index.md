abstract: "It is our view that the state of     the art in      constructing a  large collection of graph       algorithms in terms     of linear algebraic operations  is mature       enough to support       the emergence of a      standard set of primitive       building        blocks. This paper is a position paper defining the     problem and     announcing our intention to     launch an       open effort to  define this standard."
