 abstract = {In this work we present a new local, vertex-level measure of community change. Our measure detects vertices that change community membership due to the actions (edges) of a vertex itself and not only due to global community shifts. The local nature of our measure is important for analyzing real graphs because communities may change to a large degree from one snapshot in time to the next. Using both real and synthetic graphs, we compare our measure to an alternative, global approach. Both approaches detect community switching vertices in a synthetic example with little overall community change. However, when communities do not evolve smoothly over time, the global approach flags a very large number of vertices, while our local method does not.},
