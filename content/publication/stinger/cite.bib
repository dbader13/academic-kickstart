@inproceedings{STINGER,
 abstract = {The current research focus on “big data” problems highlights the scale and complexity of analytics required and the high rate at which data may be changing. In this paper, we present our high performance, scalable and portable software, Spatio-Temporal Interaction Networks and Graphs Extensible Representation (STINGER), that includes a graph data structure that enables these applications. Key attributes of STINGER are fast insertions, deletions, and updates on semantic graphs with skewed degree distributions. We demonstrate a process of algorithmic and architectural optimizations that enable high performance on the Cray XMT family and Intel multicore servers. Our implementation of STINGER on the Cray XMT processes over 3 million updates per second on a scale-free graph with 537 million edges.},
