 abstract = {Advances in experimental techniques have transformed biology into a data-intensive science, with a rapid explosion of data at the genomic and proteomic level. Few comprehensive suites of computationally-intensive life science applications are available to the computer science community for optimization of current high-performance architectures specifically targeted towards the computational biology applications. BioSplash represents a wide variety of open-source codes spanning the heterogeneity of algorithms, biological problems, popularity among biologists, and memory traits, gearing the suite to be of importance to both biologists and computer scientists.},
