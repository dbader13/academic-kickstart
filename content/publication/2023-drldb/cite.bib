 abstract = {Finding connected components is a fundamental problem in
                  graph analysis. We develop a novel minimum- mapping
                  based Contour algorithm to solve the connectivity
                  problem. The Contour algorithm can identify all
                  connected components of an undirected graph within O
                  (log 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) iterations on 𝑚 parallel processors,
                  where 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the largest diameter of all components
                  in a given graph and 𝑚 is the total number of edges
                  of the given graph. Furthermore, each iteration can
                  easily be parallelized by employing the highly
                  efficient minimum-mapping operator on all edges. To
                  improve performance, the Contour algorithm is
                  further optimized through asynchronous updates and
                  simplified atomic operations. Our algorithm has been
                  integrated into an open-source framework, Arachne,
                  that extends Arkouda for large-scale interactive
                  graph analytics with a Python API powered by the
                  high-productivity parallel language
                  Chapel. Experimental results on real-world and
                  synthetic graphs show that the proposed Contour
                  algorithm needs less number of iterations and can
                  achieve 5.26 folds of speedup on average compared
                  with the state-of-the-art connected component method
                  FastSV implemented in Chapel. All code is publicly
                  available on GitHub
                  (https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit).}
