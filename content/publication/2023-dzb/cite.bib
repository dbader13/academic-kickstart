abstract = {The suffix array is a crucial data structure for efficient
 string analysis. Over the course of twenty-six years, sequential
 suffix array construction algorithms have achieved O(n) time
 complexity and in-place sorting. In this paper, we present the Tunnel
 algorithm, the first large-scale parallel suffix array construction
 algorithm with a time complexity of O(n/p) based on the parallel
 random access machine (PRAM) model. The Tunnel algorithm is built on
 three key ideas: dividing the problem of size O(n) into p
 sub-problems of reduced size O(n/p) by replacing long suffixes with
 shorter prefixes of size at most a constant D ; introducing a Tunnel
 mechanism to efficiently induce the order of a set of suffixes with
 long common prefixes; developing a strategy to transform a partially
 ordered suffix set into a total order relation by iteratively
 applying the Tunnel inducing method. We provide a detailed
 description of the algorithm, along with a thorough analysis of its
 time and space complexity, to demonstrate its correctness and
 efficiency. The proposed Tunnel algorithm exhibits scalable
 performance, making it suitable for large string analytics on
 large-scale parallel systems.},
