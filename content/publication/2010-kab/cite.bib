 abstract = {Welcome to the 9th International Workshop on High Performance Computational Biology (HiCOMB). Computational Biology and related disciplines are fast emerging as an important area for academic research and industrial application. The large size of biological data sets, the inherent complexity of biological problems, and the ability to deal with error-prone data require the development of novel parallel algorithms in order to address the underlying computational and memory requirements. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of latest research in developing high-performance computing solutions to problems arising from molecular biology and related life sciences areas.},
