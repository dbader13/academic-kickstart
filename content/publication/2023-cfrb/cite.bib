 abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for detecting attributed
high-degree node isomorphism. High-degree isomorphic
nodes seldom happen by chance and often represent duplicated
entities or data processing errors. By definition, isomorphic nodes
are topologically indistinguishable and can be problematic in
graph ML tasks. The algorithm employs a parallel, ``degreebounded''
approach that fingerprints each nodeâ€™s local properties
through a hash, which constrains the search to nodes within hashdefined
buckets, thus minimising the number of comparisons.
This method scales on graphs with billions of nodes and edges.
Finally, we provide isomorphic node oddities identified in realworld
data.}
