 abstract = {Modern multicore and manycore systems have the strong potential to deliver both high performance and high power efficiency. The large variance in memory access latency, resource sharing, and the heterogeneity of processor architectures in modern multicore and manycore systems raise significant algorithm engineering challenges. In this article, we overview important algorithm engineering issues for modern multicore and manycore systems, and we present algorithm engineering techniques to address such problems as a guideline for practitioners.},
