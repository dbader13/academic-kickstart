abstract: "By 2010, the global options and equity markets will average over 128 billion messages per day, amountingto trillions of dollars in trades. Trading systems, the backbone of the low-latency high-frequency business,need fundamental research and innovation to overcome their current processing bottlenecks. With marketdata rates rapidly growing, the financial community is demanding solutions that are extremely fast, flexible,adaptive, and easy to manage. This paper explores multiple avenues to deal with the decoding and normalizationof Option Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) stock market data feeds encoded with FIX Adapted for Streaming(FAST) representation, on commodity multicore platforms, and describes a novel solution that encodesthe OPRA protocol with a high-level description language. Our algorithm achieves a processingrate of 15 million messages per second in the fastest single socket configuration on an Intel Xeon E5472,which is an order of magnitude higher than the current needs of the financial systems. We also presentan in-depth performance evaluation that exposes important properties of our OPRA parsing algorithm on a collectionof multicore processors."
