abstract: "Srinivas Aluru is an associate professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Education in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. He is affiliated with the Laurence H. Baker Center for Bioinformatics and Biological Statistics, and serves as associate chair for the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Graduate Program. Earlier, he held faculty positions at New Mexico State University and Syracuse University. He received his B.Tech degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India, in 1989 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from Iowa State University in 1991 and 1994, respectively. His research interests include parallel algorithms and applications, bioinformatics and computational biology, and combinatorial scientific computing. He is a recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, and a Young Engineering Faculty Research Award from Iowa State University. Dr. Aluru served on program committees and has taken up other leadership roles at several conferences and workshops in the areas of parallel processing, scientific computing, and computational biology. He is a member of ACM, and a senior member of IEEE and IEEE Computer Society. He has co-authored a book and over 40 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.  David A. Bader is an associate professor and Regents’ Lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of New Mexico (UNM). He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1995 from the University of Maryland and was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Research Associateship in Experimental Computer Science before joining UNM in 1998. He is an NSF CAREER Award recipient, an investigator on six NSF awards including three ITR awards, a distinguished speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitors Program, and is a member of the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems program. Dr. Bader serves on the steering committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences and is the general co-chair for IPDPS (2004–2005) and vice general chair for HiPC (2002–2003). He has served on numerous conference program committees related to parallel processing and is an associate editor for the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics in the area of parallel algorithms, a senior member of the IEEE Computer Society, and a member of the ACM. Dr. Bader has given several keynote talks on high-performance computing for problems in computational genomics. He has co-authored over 38 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his main areas of research are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and computational biology and genomics."
