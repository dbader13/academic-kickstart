abstract: "In the 1980s, high-performance computing (HPC) became another tool for research in the open (non-defense) science and engineering research communities. However, HPC came with a high price tag; the first Cray-2 machines, released in 1985, cost between $12 million and $17 million, according to the Computer History Museum, and were largely available only at government research labs or through national supercomputing centers. In the 1990s, with demand for HPC increasing due to vast datasets, more complex modeling, and the growing computational needs of scientific applications, researchers began experimenting with building HPC machines from clusters of servers running the Linux operating system. By the late 1990s, two approaches to Linux-based parallel computing had emerged: the personal computer cluster methodology that became known as Beowulf and the Roadrunner architecture aimed at a more cost-effective supercomputer. While Beowulf attracted attention because of its low cost and thereby greater accessibility, Roadrunner took a different approach. While still affordable compared to vector processors and other commercially available supercomputers, Roadrunner integrated its commodity components with specialized networking technology. Furthermore, these systems initially served different purposes. While Beowulf focused on providing affordable parallel workstations for individual researchers at NASA, Roadrunner set out to provide a multiuser system that could compete with the commercial supercomputers that dominated the market at the time. This paper analyzes the technical decisions, performance implications, and long-term influence of both approaches. Through this analysis, we can start to judge the impact of both Roadrunner and Beowulf on the development of Linuxbased supercomputers."
