abstract: "Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, reconstructs structural and functional brain maps at synapse-level resolution. These complex spatial maps consist of tree-like neurons interconnected by synapses. 
Motif analysis is a widely used method for identifying recurring subgraph patterns in connectomes. These motifs, thus, potentially represent fundamental units of information processing.
However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies.
In this paper, we introduce *MoMo*, a novel interactive visualization framework for analyzing *neuron morphology-aware motifs* in large connectome graphs. First, we propose an advanced graph data structure that integrates both neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. This enables highly efficient, parallel subgraph isomorphism searches, allowing for interactive morphological motif queries. Second, we develop a sketch-based interface that facilitates the intuitive exploration of morphology-based motifs within our new data structure. Users can conduct interactive motif searches on state-of-the-art connectomes and visualize results as interactive 3D renderings. We present a detailed goal and task analysis for motif exploration in connectomes, incorporating neuron morphology. Finally, we evaluate *MoMo* through case studies with four domain experts, who asses the toolâ€™s usefulness and effectiveness in motif exploration, and relevance to real-world neuroscience research.
