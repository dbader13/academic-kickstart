abstract: "As emerging applications become more and more
distributed and decentralized, how to design and build a faulttolerant
network system with high Quality of Service (QoS)
guarantee has become a challenging problem. In this paper,
we formulate an unique optimal replica placement problem in
terms of minimizing the replica placement cost subject to both
QoS and fault-tolerant constraints at the same time. Based
on the generalized graph model, we prove that the optimal
replica placement problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, our
proposed a novel heuristic based greedy solution that comprises
of two interesting rounding algorithms that are applied in tandem
on the results preprocessed by a relaxed linear programming
component. We further prove our the proposed greedy algorithm
actually is a 2-approximate algorithm."
