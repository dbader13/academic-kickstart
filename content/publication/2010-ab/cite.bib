 abstract = {The Cell Broadband Engine (or the Cell/B.E.) [6, 16, 17, 34] is a novel high-performance architecture designed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM (STI), primarily targeting multimedia and gaming applications. The Cell/B.E. consists of a traditional microprocessor (called the PPE) that controls eight SIMD co-processing units called synergistic processor elements (SPEs), a high-speed memory controller, and a high-bandwidth bus interface (termed the element interconnect bus, or EIB), all integrated on a single chip. The Cell is used in Sony’s PlayStation 3 gaming console, Mercury Computer System’s dual Cell-based blade servers, IBM’s QS20 Cell Blades, and the Roadrunner supercomputer.},
