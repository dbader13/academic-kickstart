 abstract = {Traditional scientific HPC applications running on high-end computing platforms are not the only class of applications dependent on the availability of high-performance communication services. As Chapter 12 points out, many classes of enterprise codes have strict communications requirements — airline operations systems, applications for package delivery monitoring and planning, financial trading platforms, and others. The requirements include the need for low latency and response time guarantees, as well as the ability to handle large data volumes, and are addressed by mechanisms which enable high-speed interpretation, distribution, and manipulation of the applications’ message streams, often supported by custom hardware engines.},
