IEEE Outstanding Young Engineering Award Talk, Cosponsored by the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department

**David Bader** is an Assistant Professor of EECE at the University of New Mexico (UNM).  He will review recent new engineering developments in parallel computing algorithms and parallel computers which may break the bottleneck of sequential computing for practical applications that require complex combinatorial optimization. He will demonstrate this ability to brdge this gap using problems such as aligning sequences and reconstructing evolutionary trees that arise in computational genomics and bioinformatics. David's recent research has produced a new, preliminary methodology for programming shared-memory machines and clusters of nodes. David is considered a "Mega Star" in EECE Dept., ranking in top 2 faculty, in funding, among all CE faculty.

The Science & Society Series of Talks is co-sponsored by the Sigma Xi Headquarters, the Office of the Associate Provost for Research, the Office of the Vice President for Health Sciences, the Colleges of Arts & Sciences, Education, Engineering, and Pharmacy, the Center for Radioactive Waste Management, the University Honors Program, the Department of Physics & Astronomy, the Divsion of Continuing Education, and the Albuquerque Section of the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers.
