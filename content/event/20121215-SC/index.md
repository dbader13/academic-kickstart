summary:
abstract: "Data intensive computing, popularly known as Big Data, has grown enormously in importance over the past 5 years. However, most data intensive computing is focused on conventional analytics: searching, aggregating and summarizing the data set. Graph analytics goes beyond conventional analytics to search for patterns of relationships, a capability that has important application in many HPC areas ranging from climate science to healthcare and life sciences to intelligence. The purpose of this BOF is to bring together practitioners of graph analytics. Presentations and discussions will include system architectures and software designed specifically for graph analytics; applications; and benchmarking."
