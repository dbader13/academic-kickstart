title: "SC13 Invited Panelist: Massive-Scale Graph Analytics"
event: "At the Intersection of Big Data and Extreme Computing Birds-of-a-Feather, The 25th IEEE and ACM Supercomputing Conference (SC13)"
event_url: "https://sc13.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php-evid=bof189.html"
location: "Denver, CO"
summary:
abstract: "Big Data and research computing go hand-in-hand, especially for research disciplines that operate at extreme scales. Current Big Data solutions can be improved by borrowing from HPC techniques. A panel of experts in bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, engineering mechanics / fluid dynamics, and weather modeling will review Big Data challenges in their respective disciplines and discuss where bottlenecks exist or where HPC techniques could be useful. Anyone interested in learning about Big Data challenges and applicability to specific research disciplines in particular should attend. A Q&A session with the audience will follow and audience participation in the BoF is strongly encouraged."
