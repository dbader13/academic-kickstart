title: "MuCoCoS 2008 Keynote Talk: Petascale Computing for Large-Scale Graph Problems"
event: "2008 International Workshop on Multi-Core Computing Systems (MuCoCoS'08)"
event_url: "https://web.archive.org/web/20080321155344/http://www.par.univie.ac.at/~pllana/mucocos08/"
location: "Barcelona, Spain"
summary:
abstract: "Graph theoretic problems are representative of fundamental kernels in
traditional and emerging computational sciences such as chemistry,
biology, and medicine, as well as applications in national
security. Yet they pose serious challenges for parallel machines due
to non-contiguous, concurrent accesses to global data structures with
low degrees of locality.  Few parallel graph algorithms outperform
their best sequential implementation due to long memory latencies and
high synchronization costs.  In this talk, we consider several graph
theoretic kernels for connectivity and centrality and discuss how the
features of petascale architectures will affect algorithm development,
ease of programming, performance, and scalability."
