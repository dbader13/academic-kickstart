## Workshop on Building Scalable Simulations of Complex Socio-Technical Systems ##

Complex socio-technical systems consist of a large number of
interacting physical, technological, and human/societal
components. Examples of such systems are urban regional transportation
systems, national electrical powermarkets and grids, the Internet,
ad-hoc communication and computing systems, public health,
etc. Realistic social and infrastructure networks spanning urban
regions are extremely large: consisting of millions of nodes and
edges. As a result, the detailed simulations capable of representing
such systems consist of millions of interacting agents. The challenges
pertaining to design and implementations of such simulations on high
performance computing platforms are unique, e.g., computation of
extremely large dynamic unstructured composed networks. The workshop
aims to bring together some of the leading researchers with the goal
of identifying fundamental issues in designing, implementing and using
such simulations on current and next generation high performance
computing architectures. Examples of topics that will be covered
include scalable HPC oriented design of such simulations; distributed
algorithms and their implementations; formal specifications and
simulation specific HPC system software.
