abstract: "Advances in computers, mobile devices, nanotechnologies and cyberinfrastructure are at the vanguard of profound transformations across society, in communications, healthcare, business and commerce, defense and even politics. Fueling this revolution are vast amounts of data and data analytics, gathered from a proliferating number of sources, that bring new information to manage almost every application around us to co-evolve in the society.

As we grow more reliant on high-performing digital infrastructure, however, it is paramount that we ensure the integrity and security of the data we’re processing. From social networking to point-of-care technologies in healthcare, to, more generally, data analytics that help us manage and mitigate risks around us, peoples’ lives depend on it. Data that is inaccurate, partial, or manipulated, that is viewed out of context or that fails to represent diverse populations, for example, can be more harmful than no data at all.

This National Academies of Inventors-NJIT Workshop on Sustainable Societies, the third in a series launched last year, will provide an open forum for researchers, policymakers, government regulators and business and nonprofit leaders to share their different perspectives and niche expertise on the data revolution. Among other topics, we will hear about the state of advances in data analytics, informatics infrastructure, data-fueled approaches in healthcare including cancer management along with the experiences of a serial technology entrepreneur. The Open forum will also focus on current and future trends in using data analytics, machine learning and AI in addressing complex societal and technology needs but also learn how to evolve with the trustworthy dependence on their use in our lives."
