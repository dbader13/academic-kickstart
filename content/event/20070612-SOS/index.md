Whether petascale computing can be sustained into the future; or whether power, space, and cost will restrict the number of sites around the world is the central question for SOS11.  The SOS series of workshops aims to assemble interdisciplinary teams and collaboratories to develop the required, state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and software, supported by appropriate hardware and middleware infrastructure to use petascale (and beyond) computing resources effectively to advance fundamental research in compelling scientific missions.  The overarching goal of the first SOS meeting was to familiarize all participants with the overall integrated SOS program and to initiate team building both across DOE laboratories and with academia to support that integration across projects.

The theme is "Challenges of Sustained Petascale Computation."
