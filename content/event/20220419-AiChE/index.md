summary:
abstract: "Quantum computing is the processing of information that’s represented by special quantum states. By tapping into quantum phenomena like “superposition” and “entanglement,” these machines handle information in a fundamentally different way to “classical” computers like smartphones, laptops, or even today’s most powerful supercomputers. Researchers have long predicted that quantum computers could tackle certain types of problems — especially those involving a daunting number of variables and potential outcomes, like simulations or optimization questions — much faster than any classical computer. Quantum computing is a revolutionary new way to build computers that take advantage of Quantum circuits and promise to outperform classical supercomputers in several problem domains. **David Bader** will present an overview of Quantum Computing and discuss how it works, machine designs, the leading Quantum computers, and quantum applications."
