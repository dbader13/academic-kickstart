summary:
abstract: "Large-scale data analytics applications represent increasingly important workloads but most of today's supercomputers are ill suited to them. Backed by a steering committee of over 30 international HPC experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories, Graph500 works to establish large-scale benchmarks that are representative of these workloads. This BOF will unveil the seventh Graph500 list, and an improved second benchmark. We will further explore the new energy metrics for the Green Graph500, and unveil the second Green Graph500 list."
