summary:
abstract: "In the last 5-10 years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) not only emerged as a new target class of applications for HPC researchers, but papers focusing on these workloads have started dominating HPC conferences. Rapidly increasing size of state-of-the-art DNN models has continued this strong interest, with efforts being made in each of the areas of architectures, programming systems, algorithms, and tuning of applications. Year 2023 may be a good time for the community to ask:  “What will be the next big application class or classes  that will excite and drive HPC researchers in the near future.’’ Trends in life sciences, materials, climate, secure computing, and/or others may provide certain clues in answering this question.  This panel will examine this open-ended question with a set of leading researchers and with active audience participation."
