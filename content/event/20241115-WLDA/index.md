abstract: "The future of computing is being driven by the convergence of high-performance computing (HPC) and the growing potential of quantum technologies, combined with advanced frameworks for massive-scale data analytics. As organizations confront the challenge of analyzing vast, complex datasets across domains like cybersecurity, genomics, and artificial intelligence, new tools such as Arachne—a cutting-edge open-source platform for large-scale graph analytics—are paving the way for faster, more interactive data processing and insight generation.

Arachne, built on the Arkouda framework, offers innovative algorithms and efficient implementations designed specifically for HPC environments, enabling rapid analysis of tens of terabytes of data. This talk by Dr. David Bader, a pioneer in both quantum and HPC, will delve into the unique capabilities of Arachne, including its ability to handle complex graph analytics tasks, such as connected components, triangle counting, and k-truss decomposition, in real-time. He will also discuss enhancements to graph data structures that support diverse types of data, including node labels and edge properties, allowing more nuanced analysis.

The integration of HPC with quantum technologies is also beginning to reshape how we approach massive-scale analytics. Although still in its early stages, quantum computing offers promising pathways for tackling problems that are currently computationally infeasible. This talk will explore how quantum advancements might complement existing HPC frameworks, further enhancing data processing capabilities and potentially accelerating breakthroughs in various sectors.

Attendees will gain insights into the strategic importance of combining HPC and quantum capabilities with sophisticated data analytics tools to remain at the forefront of technological innovation. The session will highlight the challenges and opportunities in adopting these next-generation technologies, offering a roadmap for organizations preparing to meet future computational demands.

Key Takeaways:

* Explore Arachne’s role in revolutionizing large-scale, interactive graph analytics within HPC environments.

* Understand the potential of quantum computing to complement HPC in data-intensive applications.

* Learn about the innovative algorithms and improvements in data structures that drive Arachne's performance.

* Identify the challenges and strategies for adopting advanced computational technologies.

* Gain insights into future trends shaping the next era of computing.

## Brief Biography: ##

David A. Bader is a Distinguished Professor and founder of the Department of Data Science and inaugural Director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Prior to this, he served as founding Professor and Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology. Bader is an elected Board Member of the Computing Research Association (CRA), and previously served on the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors. Dr. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, AAAS, and SIAM; a recipient of the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award; and the 2022 Innovation Hall of Fame inductee of the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering. He advises the White House, most recently on the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem (FACE). Bader is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science. His interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing and real-world applications, including cybersecurity, massive-scale analytics, and computational genomics, and he has co-authored over 300 scholarly papers and has best paper awards from ISC, IEEE HPEC, and IEEE/ACM SC. Dr. Bader has served as a lead scientist in several DARPA programs including High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) with IBM, Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) with NVIDIA, Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS), Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT), Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE), and Software-Defined Hardware (SDH). Recently, Bader received an NVIDIA AI Lab (NVAIL) award, and a Facebook Research AI Hardware/Software Co-Design award. Dr. Bader is Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing, and previously served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. He serves on the leadership team of Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub as the inaugural chair of the Seed Fund Steering Committee. ROI-NJ recognized Bader as a technology influencer on its 2021 inaugural and 2022 lists. In 2012, Bader was the inaugural recipient of University of Maryland’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2014, Bader received the Outstanding Senior Faculty Research Award from Georgia Tech. Bader is a member of Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Honor Society), Eta Kappa Nu (Electrical Engineering Honor Society), and Omicron Delta Kappa (National Leadership Honor Society). Bader has also served as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor and Director of an NVIDIA GPU Center of Excellence. In 1998, Bader built the first Linux supercomputer that led to a high-performance computing (HPC) revolution, and Hyperion Research estimates that the total economic value of Linux supercomputing pioneered by Bader has been over $100 trillion over the past 25 years. The Computer History Museum recognizes Bader for developing the first Linux-based supercomputer which became the predominant architecture for all major supercomputers in the world. Bader is a cofounder of the Graph500 List for benchmarking “Big Data” computing platforms. He is recognized as a “RockStar” of High Performance Computing by InsideHPC and as HPCwire’s People to Watch in 2012 and 2014.
