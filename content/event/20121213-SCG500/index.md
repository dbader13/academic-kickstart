summary:
abstract: "Data intensive applications represent increasingly important workloads but are ill suited for most of todays machines. The Graph500 has demonstrated the challenges of even simple analytics. Backed by a steering committee of over 30 international HPC experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories, this effort serves to enhance data intensive workloads for the community. This BOF will unveil the fifth Graph500 list, and delve into the specification for the second kernel. We will further explore the new energy metrics for the Green Graph500, and unveil the first results."
