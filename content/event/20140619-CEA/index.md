summary:
abstract: "Emerging real-world graph problems include detecting community
structure in large social networks, improving the resilience of the
electric power grid, and detecting and preventing disease in human
populations. Unlike traditional applications in computational
science and engineering, solving these problems at scale often raises
new challenges because of sparsity and the lack of locality in the
data, the need for additional research on scalable algorithms and
development of frameworks for solving these problems on high
performance computers, and the need for improved models that also
capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In
this talk, the speaker will discuss the opportunities and challenges in
massive data-intensive computing for applications in computational
biology, genomics, and security. This talk will highlight the
importance of a portfolio of high performance computing and big
data platforms for massive data analytics."

**David A. Bader** is a Full Professor in the School of
Computational Science and Engineering, College of
Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology, and
Executive Director for High Performance Computing.
Dr. Bader serves as a Board member of the Computing
Research Association (CRA), and on the Steering
Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences. He is
Program Chair for IPDPS 2014, and has served as the
General Chair of IPDPS 2010 and Chair of SIAM
PP12. He is an associate editor-in-chief of the Journal
of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC), and
editor-in-chief of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel
and Distributed Systems (TPDS). Dr. Bader's interests
are at the intersection of high-performance computing
and real-world applications, including computational
biology and genomics and massive-scale data
analytics. He is also a leading expert on multicore,
manycore, and multithreaded computing for dataintensive
applications such as those in massive-scale
graph analytics. He has co-authored over 130 articles
in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his
main areas of research are in parallel algorithms,
combinatorial optimization, massive-scale social
networks, and computational biology and genomics.
Prof. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE and AAAS, a
National Science Foundation CAREER Award
recipient, and has received numerous industrial awards
from IBM, NVIDIA, Intel, Cray, Oracle/Sun
Microsystems, and Microsoft Research. Bader is a cofounder
of the Graph500 List for benchmarking "Big
Data" computing platforms. Bader is recognized as a
"RockStar" of High Performance Computing by
InsideHPC and as HPCwire's People to Watch in 2012.
