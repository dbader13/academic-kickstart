Data analytics are an integral part of data science. The introduction of new scalable and high-performance data analytics frameworks, including the use of accelerators such as GPUs, has enabled data scientists to inspect their data and extract insights previously unattainable. In the last decade, the GPU has trailblazed this new exciting field of high-performance data analytics. This session will cover recent developments that have helped scale data analytics on the GPU to new heights. We will focus on analytics in social network analysis, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity, to name a few. We will also focus on other foundational components of scalable data analytics such as communication, data structures, algorithms, and ETL.
