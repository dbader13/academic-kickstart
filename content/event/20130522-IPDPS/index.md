abstract: "Panel Discussion Abstract: There is a lot of excitement about “Big Data” which is at the intersection of the ongoing explosion in data (volumes, variety, and velocity at which it arrives and must be acted upon), the dramatic increase in cost-effective memory capacities, and the maturation of scale-out processing technologies. Huge investments are being made, and there are great expectations for the gains to be had and the range of applications that will be transformed by new data-driven approaches. What does the future hold? Will the changes indeed be transformative, and if so, what will some of the main changes be? What domains are likely to benefit the most? Or is this just a case of unrealistic expectations waiting to be debunked by reality? We will ask panelists drawn from diverse backgrounds to offer their opinions and, hopefully, to get into violent arguments!"
