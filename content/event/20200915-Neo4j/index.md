Government agencies across the globe are challenged with complex, ever-evolving problems. The answers exist somewhere in a vast amount of data, but they are only identifiable with the right technology to make sense of the interconnectedness within your data. That technology is a graph database.

This online event is a full day of thought leadership on graphs in government, featuring speakers from **New Jersey Institute of Technology**, Northrop Grumman and Turku City Data, as well as Neo4j experts like our Chief Scientist, Jim Webber.
