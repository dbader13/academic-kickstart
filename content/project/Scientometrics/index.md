Community detection methods enable an understanding of the structure of networks at multiple scales. While many methods exist, only a few are able to scale to large networks and/or are implemented in large computational infrastructure. As we have recently shown, even those that scale to large datasets, fail to reliably produce well-connected clusters. Finally, given that the choice of clustering method depends on both the network being analyzed and the question of interest, providing the domain specialist a choice of multiple clustering methodologies within a common framework for exploratory data analysis, is essential. This project will make substantial advances on these challenges through the coordinated development of advanced cyber-infrastructure, scalable to very large networks, that offers multiple options for community detection, search, and extraction. The infrastructure will be accessible across platforms ranging from laptops to multi-node clusters with distributed memory.
