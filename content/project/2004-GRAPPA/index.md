GRAPPA is available as a gzipped tar file containing all source files needed to compile an executable version. Documentation for this early release is minimal (there is a README file and some online help). GRAPPA changes quickly, so be sure to grab the latest release.

GRAPPA was featured in Access, the magazine of the NCSA/Alliance in [Vol. 14 (1)](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/News/Access/Stories/phylogeny/) (Spring 2001). It is discussed at some length in

* Moret, B.M.E., Wyman, S., Bader, D.A., Warnow, T., and Yan, M., "A new implementation and detailed study of breakpoint analysis," *Proc. 6th Pacific Symp. on Biocomputing (PSB 2001)*, Hawaii, World Scientific Pub. (2001), 583-594. [PS](psb1.ps)

Its linear-time computation of inversion distance is presented in

* Bader, D.A., Moret, B.M.E., and Yan, M., ``A linear-time algorithm for computing inversion distances between signed permutations with an experimental study,'' *Proc. 7th Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 01)*, Providence (2001), Lecture Notes in Computer Science **2125**, 365-376, Springer Verlag. Journal version appears in *J. Comput. Biol.* **8**, 5 (2001), 483-491. [PDF](jcb01.pdf)

The improvements due to better bounding and new search ordering (the layered method) are discussed in

* Moret, B.M.E., Tang, J., Wang, L.S., and Warnow, T., "Steps toward accurate reconstruction of phylogenies from gene-order data," to appear in *J. Comput. Syst. Sci.* (invited, special issue on computational biology), 2002. [PS](jcss.ps)

while the improvements achieved through the use of true inversion medians are documented in

* Moret, B.M.E., Siepel, A.C., Tang, J., and Liu, T., "Inversion medians outperform breakpoint medians in phylogeny reconstruction from gene-order data," *Proc. 2nd Int'l Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI'02)*, Rome (2002), to appear in *Lecture Notes in Computer Science* **2452**, 2002. [PS](wabi02a.ps)

which also contains references to the works of A. Caprara and of A. Siepel, whose codes for the computation of true inversion medians are included in this release.
The latest release is

[GRAPPA-2.0](GRAPPA20.tar.gz)

from October 1, 2004.
Previous releases (1.6 and 1.03) are obsolete.

You may want to look at some [test data](testsets.tar.gz).
