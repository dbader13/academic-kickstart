[Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez](https://www.oliveralvaradorodriguez.net/)
completed his doctorate in computer science at the Ying Wu College
of Computing in May 2025. He performs research under the supervision of
Distinguished Professor David Bader. He received his B.S. in computer
science with a minor in mathematics from William Paterson University
in Wayne, NJ in May 2020 with summa cum laude honors.  During his
undergraduate studies, he was a member of the Honors College, a part
of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon honor society for computing and information
disciplines and was also awarded the Omicron Omega award for
excellence in computer science. His research interests lie in the
intersection of high-performance computing and data
science. Specifically, he is interested in the design and
implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software to
facilitate large-scale graph analysis. He was awarded a best paper
presentation award at the 2020 Big Data and Machine Learning
conference for his presentation on the paper titled “A Study of
Machine Learning Inference Benchmarks”, done in collaboration with Dev
Dave and under the tutelage of Dr. Weihua Liu and Dr. Bogong Su.
Oliver served as the student keynote speaker at the Spring 2022
meeting of the Academic Data Science Alliance, where he presented the
keynote talk “Enabling Exploratory Large-Scale Graph Analytics through
Arkouda.”

Oliver is natively from Costa Rica, having moved with his family to
the United States in 2003 when he was five. Oliver is a Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, the landmark executive
order passed by President Barack Obama on June 12, 2012. Were it not
for DACA, Oliver would be unable to study and work within the United
States. Oliver is also a first-generation college graduate and the
first member of his family to pursue a Ph.D. He grew up in Paterson,
NJ, attended high school and college in Wayne, NJ, and decided to
pursue his Ph.D. at NJIT when he found amazing research opportunities
and was offered a research assistant position with his advisor, David
Bader.

Oliver will join Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) in June 2025.
