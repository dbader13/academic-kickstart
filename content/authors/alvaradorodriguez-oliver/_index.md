[Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez](https://www.oliveralvaradorodriguez.net/)
completed his doctorate in Computer Science at the Ying Wu College of Computing in May 2025 under the supervision of Distinguished Professor David A. Bader. He received his B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from William Paterson University in Wayne, NJ in May 2020 with summa cum laude honors. During his undergraduate studies, he was a member of the Honors College, part of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon honor society for computing and information disciplines, and was awarded the Omicron Omega award for excellence in Computer Science.

His research interests lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and data science, specifically in the design and implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software to facilitate large-scale graph analytics.

As of June 2025, Oliver is a Research Software Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise working on the [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/) Programming Language team.
