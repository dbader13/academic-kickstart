As a computational ecologist, Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf works at the unique intersection of computer science, data science, wildlife biology and social sciences. She creates computational solutions to address questions such as how environmental factors affect the behaviors of social animals (humans included). She is also a founding member and project lead for Wildbook (a project of the non-profit Wild Me), an open source software platform that supports the use of AI, computer vision, citizen science and collaboration to accelerate wildlife research to understand and counter widespread wildlife decline.

Tanya came to Ohio State from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she was a professor of computer science and headed the Computational Population Biology Laboratory. Prior to her time there, she was an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the University of New Mexico and at the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS), a collaborative project of Rutgers University, AT&T Labs â€“ Research, NEC Laboratories America, Nokia Bell Labs, Perspecta Labs, and Princeton University.
