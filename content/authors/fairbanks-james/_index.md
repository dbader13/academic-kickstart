James Fairbanks is an Assistant Professor in the Computer &
Information Science & Engineering Department of the University of
Florida. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics at the University of
Florida and his Ph.D at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
Computational Science and Engineering. He studied under the
supervision of Professor David A. Bader, while supported by the
National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship.
During his graduate studies, James applied numerical analysis to graph
mining algorithms such as Spectral Clustering and Algebraic Graph
Centralities to develop both theoretical results connecting numerical
accuracy to data analysis quality and practical improvements to
iterative solvers for said problems. He then worked at the Georgia
Tech Research Institute on Data Analysis and High Performance
Computing as applied to scientific computing and data science problems
in healthcare. social science, epidemiology, biology, and physics
problems. His work focuses on using programming language theory and
algebraic techniques for designing and developing large scale software
for technical computing problems. He has been a significant
contributor to the Julia language for technical computing since 2015.
