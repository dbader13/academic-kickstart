[13th International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics (PPAM)](https://ppam.pl/),
Bialystok, Poland,
September 9, 2019.



Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these social problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for research on scalable algorithms and architectures, and development of frameworks for solving these real-world problems on high performance computers, and for improved models that capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, Bader will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data science for applications in social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.

*The PPAM 2019 conference is organized by the Department of Computer and Information Science of the Czestochowa University of Technology together with the Bialystok University of Technology, under the patronage of the Committee of Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, in technical cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.*
