## Brief Biography ##

**David A. Bader** is a Full Professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, College of
Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology, and Executive Director for High Performance Computing.
Dr. Bader is a lead scientist in the DARPA Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) program. He
received his Ph.D. in 1996 from The University of Maryland, and his research is supported through highlycompetitive research awards, primarily from NSF, NIH, DARPA, and DOE. Dr. Bader serves on the
Research Advisory Council for Internet2, the Steering Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences, the
General Chair of IPDPS 2010 and Chair of SIAM PP12. He is an associate editor for several high impact
publications including the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC), ACM Journal of
Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), IEEE DSOnline, Parallel Computing, and Journal of Computational
Science, and has been an associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
(TPDS). He was elected as chair of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Parallel
Processing (TCPP) and as chair of the SIAM Activity Group in Supercomputing (SIAG / SC). Dr. Bader's
interests are at the intersection of high-performance computing and real-world applications, including
computational biology and genomics and massive-scale data analytics. He has co-chaired a series of
meetings, the IEEE International Workshop on High-Performance Computational Biology (HiCOMB), coorganized the NSF Workshop on Petascale Computing in the Biological Sciences, written several book
chapters, and co-edited special issues of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC) and
IEEE TPDS on high-performance computational biology. He is also a leading expert on multicore,
manycore, and multithreaded computing for data-intensive applications such as those in massive-scale
graph analytics. He has co-authored over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his
main areas of research are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, massive-scale social
networks, and computational biology and genomics. Prof. Bader is a Fellow of the IEEE and AAAS, a
National Science Foundation CAREER Award recipient, and has received numerous industrial awards from
IBM, NVIDIA, Intel, Cray, Oracle/Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft Research. He served as a member of
the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems program, was a distinguished
speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitors Program, and has also served as Director of
the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor. Bader is
recognized as a "RockStar" of High Performance Computing by InsideHPC and as HPCwire's People to
Watch in 2012.
