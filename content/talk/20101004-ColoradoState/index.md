title: "Colorado State ISTeC Distinguished Lecture: Petascale Computing for Computational Biology and Genomics"
event: "Colorado State ISTeC Distinguished Lecture"
event_url: "http://istec.colostate.edu/activities/events-past"
location: "Fort Collins, CO"
summary:
abstract: "Graph theoretic problems are representative of fundamental
kernels in traditional and emerging computational sciences such as
chemistry, biology, and medicine, as well as applications in national
security. Yet they pose serious challenges for parallel machines due
to non-contiguous, concurrent accesses to global data structures with
low degrees of locality. Few parallel graph algorithms outperform
their best sequential implementation due to long memory latencies and
high synchronization costs. In this talk, we consider several graph
theoretic kernels for connectivity and centrality and discuss how the
features of petascale architectures will affect algorithm development,
ease of programming, performance, and scalability. Our large-scale
graph algorithms are applied to real-world problems in phylogenetic
reconstruction of evolutionary histories, inference of gene function
in protein interaction networks, and cancer research."

## Speaker Biography ##

**David A. Bader** is a Full Professor in the School of Computational
Science and Engineering, College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of
Technology. He received his Ph.D. in 1996 from The University of
Maryland, was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral
Research Associateship in Experimental Computer Science. He is an NSF
CAREER Award recipient, an investigator on several NSF and NIH awards,
was a distinguished speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished
Visitors Program, and a member of the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA
High Productivity Computing Systems program. Bader currently serves on
the NVIDIA-Cray team under the DARPA Ubiquitous High Performance
Computing program. Dr. Bader directed the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of
Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor. Dr. Bader also
serves on the Research Advisory Council for Internet2, the Steering
Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences, and is the General Chair
of IPDPS 2010 and Chair of SIAM PP12. He is an associate editor for
several high impact publications including the ACM Journal of
Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), IEEE DSOnline, and Parallel
Computing, has been an associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on
Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). He is an IEEE Fellow and a
Member of the ACM. Dr. Bader's interests are at the intersection of
high-performance computing and computational biology and genomics. He
has co-chaired the IEEE International Workshop on High-Performance
Computational Biology (HiCOMB), co-organized the NSF Workshop on
Petascale Computing in the Biological Sciences, written several book
chapters, and co-edited special issues of the Journal of Parallel and
Distributed Computing (JPDC) and IEEE TPDS on high-performance
computational biology. He has co-authored over 100 articles in
peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his main areas of research
are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and
computational biology and genomics.
