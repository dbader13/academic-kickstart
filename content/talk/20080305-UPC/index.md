title: "Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya HPC Seminar: Petascale Computing for Large-Scale Graph Problems"
event: "High Performance Computing Group seminar, Computer Architecture Department, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya"
event_url: "http://research.ac.upc.edu/HPCseminar/SEM0708/seminariCAP.html"
location: "Barcelona, Spain"
summary:
abstract: "Graph theoretic problems are representative of fundamental kernels in traditional and emerging computational sciences such as chemistry, biology, and medicine, as well as applications in national security. Yet they pose serious challenges for parallel machines due to non-contiguous, concurrent accesses to global data structures with low degrees of locality. Few parallel graph algorithms outperform their best sequential implementation due to long memory latencies and high synchronization costs. In this talk, we consider several graph theoretic kernels for connectivity and centrality and discuss how the features of petascale architectures will affect algorithm development, ease of programming, performance, and scalability."

## Biography ##

**David A. Bader** is Executive Director of High-Performance Computing and an Associate Professor in Computational Science and Engineering, a division within the College of Computing, at Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Bader also serves as Director of the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor located at Georgia Tech. He received his Ph.D. in 1996 from The University of Maryland, was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Research Associateship in Experimental Computer Science. He is an NSF CAREER Award recipient, an investigator on several NSF awards, was a distinguished speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitors Program, and a member of the IBM PERCS team for the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems program. Dr. Bader serves on the Research Advisory Council of Internet2 and the Steering Committees of the IPDPS and HiPC conferences, and was the General co-Chair for IPDPS (2004--2005), and Vice General Chair for HiPC (2002--2004). David has chaired several major conference program committees: Program Chair for HiPC 2005, Program Vice-Chair for IPDPS 2006 and Program Vice-Chair for ICPP 2006, and has served on numerous conference program committees related to parallel processing and computational science & engineering, is an associate editor for several high impact publications including the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS), the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), IEEE DSOnline, and Parallel Computing, is a Senior Member of the IEEE Computer Society and a Member of the ACM. Dr. Bader has been a pioneer in the field of high-performance computing for problems in bioinformatics and computational genomics. He has co-chaired a series of meetings, the IEEE International Workshop on High-Performance Computational Biology (HiCOMB), written several book chapters, and co-edited special issues of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC) and IEEE TPDS on high-performance computational biology. He has co-authored over 90 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and his main areas of research are in parallel algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and computational biology and genomics.
