summary:
abstract: "On July 29, 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the National
Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) to ensure the United States continues leading in this field
over the coming decades. The White House National Strategic
Computing Initiative Workshop was held at the request of the NSCI Executive Council, on
October 20 and 21, 2015. The goal of
the workshop was to capture the full breadth of the participants’ individual opinions and ideas
on four NSCI themes:
-  Convergence of data analytics and computationally-intensive computing
-  Future computing technology (beyond Moore’s Law)
-  Improving productivity in HPC application development and deployment
-  Workforce development
The two-day workshop brought together approximately 250 participants representing industry,
government, academia, and other organizations. The workshop was the first public forum
where stakeholders from different sectors could share opinions on the challenges and
opportunities of increasing computing demands, the increasing role of big data, and the
evolving technological landscape in high performance computing (HPC)"
