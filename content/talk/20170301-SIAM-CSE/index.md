This forward-looking panel will explore the future of CSE in a broad academic context. What new "grand challenges" may drive progress in CSE? How can CSE shape the future of new application fields such as computational medicine and biology, computational geoscience, and materials science? Are there opportunities to extend CSE to new areas such as social network analysis, cybersecurity and the social sciences, with mathematics-based large-scale computing rapidly becoming of crucial importance in almost all areas of society? Is the CSE paradigm and focus sufficiently unique and significant to warrant separate programs, graduate degrees, academic departments, and funding streams?
